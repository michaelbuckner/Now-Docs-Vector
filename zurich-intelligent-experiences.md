# General guidelines for writing instructions for generative AI large language models (LLMs)

When using Now Assist products and skills, you may have the option to give specific instructions or other guidance to the LLM. Writing generative AI instructions is different from conducting a keyword search. Use the following general guidelines when crafting your instructions.

Writing instructions for generative AI is very different from using search keywords. Keywords are the words that you might expect to appear in your results. For example, if you search for "gray bobtail cats," then you can reasonably expect your search results to return with topics or media that is about gray cats, bobtail cats, or even just cats in general. But with generative AI, you are asking the LLM to perform a task for you. The phrase "gray bobtail cats" does not include a verb to tell the LLM what to do. What about these gray cats? Should it locate all there is to know about them? Should it find gray bobtail cats to adopt? Should it create a picture of a gray bobtail cat? Should it be a realistic picture, or more of a line drawing? Generative AI needs more than just keywords.

# General LLM instructions

Use instructions or questions to tell the LLM what you want. They can include four parts:

- Goal
What kind of result do you want from the LLM?

Example: I want a list of 3-5 bullet points to prepare me...
- Context
Why do you need it, and who is involved?

Example: ...for an upcoming meeting with [client], focusing on their current state and what they're looking to achieve with their "Phase 3+" brand campaign.
- Expectations
How should the LLM best fulfill your request?

Example: Please use simple language so I can get up to speed quickly.
- Source
What information or other resources would you like the LLM to use?

Example: Focus on email and Teams chats with [people] since June.

Sample LLM instructions

Continually test and refine your instructions. Creating good LLM instructions is an iterative process, and as the LLM model learns, you may want to modify your instructions over time.

# Stating your goal

When constructing an LLM description or instruction, consider these basic guidelines.

- Lead with action verbs. Use the imperative form or direct commands.
- Be direct and use simple sentences rather than complex ones.
- Be specific.
- Don't use jargon or slang terms.
- Avoid references to third parties or pronouns. Removing the subject or any identifiers generally prevents the LLM from personifying or otherwise misidentifying the end user.
- Your words instruct the logic that generative AI will use. Detailed, chain-of-thought instructions work well for this.

Instructions should also be tailored to the type of task. The following table describes the different kinds of tasks and the sort of instructions you might write for each circumstance.

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Task type</td>
<td>Description</td>
<td>Example instruction</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Simple search</td>
<td>Simple search for an answer.</td>
<td>When is the next company holiday?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Answer</td>
<td>Gather information from multiple sources and provide a summarized answer.</td>
<td>What were the major customer support issues in the past 30 days?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Chat</td>
<td>A back-and-forth conversation in which the LLM is getting additional information from the requester.</td>
<td>I have a new phone and now I can’t access Okta.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Create</td>
<td>Create a new ServiceNow component.</td>
<td>Write a new KB on common reasons for slow query execution and how to fix it, based on problems created in the last 12 months.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Workflow</td>
<td>Leverage existing workflows and create conversations from them.</td>
<td>Reset my Okta password.</td>
</tr>

# LLM instruction workflow

Providing context in your instructions

Providing context to the LLM may feel like you are stating the obvious. For example, you may need to explain why your user would want to perform the task, or explain more about what the task is about. If you're using language that could have alternative meanings, you may want to define your terms. For example, if your instructions are about Microsoft Teams, you may need to say something like, "Teams refers to Microsoft Teams, an application that employees in a company can use to communicate with one another individually or in groups."

When providing context, think about the target audience for the task. This will help you to write better instructions. Mentioning whom the task is for also helps the LLM carry out the task.

# Types of users to consider:

- Admins
Admins configure skills in the Now Assist Admin console. They work with platform owners and product owners for tasks and requirements. Subject-matter experts check the accuracy of generative AI results. Governance boards or committees may oversee final sign-off on the skill.
- Builders
Builders create assets such as applications and workflows. Their skill level may vary from no-code, low-code, mid-skill, or high-skill. They mostly interact with each other and admins.
- Agents
Agents provide technical assistance, customer support, or other problem-solving help for users of a product, service, or organization. Agents work with their peers and support many kinds of requesters.
- Requesters
Requesters may include your organization's employees, partners, or customers. Requesters encounter generative AI mostly in a self-service context. Generative AI provides the opportunity to requesters to solve the problem themselves before they resort to asking an agent for help.

# In addition, you may need to "instruct" the LLM how to arrive at the kind of answer you want.

Detailed chain-of-thought instructions are more likely to produce the results you're looking for. If you make assumptions in your instructions, your results may vary wildly.

# Example of chain-of-thought instructions

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Standard instructions</td>
<td>Chain-of-thought instructions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Q: Start with 5 tennis balls. Buy 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls are there now?</td>
<td>Q: Start with 5 tennis balls. Buy 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls are there now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A: The answer is 11.</td>
<td>A: There are 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5+6=11. The answer is 11.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If the cafeteria used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples does the cafeteria have?</td>
<td>Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If the cafeteria used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples does the cafeteria have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A: The answer is 27.</td>
<td>A: The cafeteria had 23 apples originally. They used 20 to make lunch. So they had 23-20=3. They bought 6 more apples, so they have 3+6=9. The answer is 9.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

# Expectations

You can specify how you want your results to sound and look. For example, you can tell the LLM what kind of tone you want it to use.

# Modifying the tone of LLM results

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Instruction</td>
<td>LLM result</td>
<td>Evaluation of result</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Greet the user with a casual, laid-back tone.</td>
<td>Hey there! (: Welcome to May 22, 2024, a Wednesday. Chill and have a great day!</td>
<td>Too casual!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Greet the user with a professional, business-like tone.</td>
<td>Good day, welcome to our business. How may I assist you today?</td>
<td>A little too formal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Greet the user with a professional, but friendly tone.</td>
<td>Hello there! I'm glad to assist you today, May 22, 2024. How can I help you?</td>
<td>Great, but I don't want the date.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Greet the user with a professional, but friendly tone. Do not include the date.</td>
<td>Hello! I'm here to help. How can I assist you today?</td>
<td>Perfect.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

# Instruction

In some Now Assist applications, you may have the option to specify formatting. In those cases, you can tell the LLM to provide answers in a bulleted list, for example. Bulleted lists are often easier to read.

---


# Enabling bulleted list results in the chat summarization skill

Source

You can suggest a variety of sources that the LLM should use to find answers, including Microsoft Teams conversations, Microsoft SharePoint Online sites, incidents and cases, and internal knowledge articles. In order for an agent or skill to access all of these sources, an admin must configure access on the instance.

For developers, the sources that a skill or AI agent can access may vary depending on the desired outcome. For example, the incident summarization skill uses the Incident table as its source. AI agents use different tools and knowledge sources, customized for the task they perform.

For more information about configuring sources for skill or AI agent use, see the following topic areas:

# AI limitations

This application uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, which are rapidly evolving fields of study that generate predictions based on patterns in data. As a result, this application may not always produce accurate, complete, or appropriate information. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that this application has been fully trained or tested for your use case. To mitigate these issues, it is your responsibility to test and evaluate your use of this application for accuracy, harm, and appropriateness for your use case, employ human oversight of output, and refrain from relying solely on AI-generated outputs for decision-making purposes. This is especially important if you choose to deploy this application in areas with consequential impacts such as healthcare, finance, legal, employment, security, or infrastructure. You agree to abide by ServiceNow’s AI Acceptable Use Policy, which may be updated by ServiceNow.

# Data processing

This application requires data to be transferred from ServiceNow customers' individual instances to a centralized ServiceNow environment, which may be located in a different data center region from the one where your instance is, and potentially to a third-party cloud provider, such as Microsoft Azure. This data is handled per ServiceNow's internal policies and procedures, including our policies available through our CORE Compliance Portal.

# Data collection

ServiceNow collects and uses the inputs, outputs, and edits to outputs of this application to develop and improve ServiceNow technologies including ServiceNow models and AI products. Customers can opt out of future data collection at any time, as described in the Now Assist Opt-Out page.

# Exploring Now Assist

Learn how Now Assist brings generative AI capabilities to the ServiceNow AI Platform. With Now Assist, you can improve the productivity and efficiency in your organization, deliver better self-service, recommend actions and provide answers, and empower your users to search more effectively.

# Now Assist overview

Now Assist is a growing cross-platform family of generative AI features, which are tasks that a large language model (LLM) can perform. Generative AI features are based on the initial training and architecture.

A skill delivers a feature plus the use case to the user. An example of a skill is chat summarization within a customer workspace. Now Assist products provide features and skills that are tailored to meet the needs of users in different workflows.

# Sentiment Analysis

Apply Now Assist Sentiment Analysis to each customer interaction to assess user satisfaction and facilitate informed decision-making. The customer communications can be related to cases, records, or problems. Use this skill to prioritise this data based on the overall sentiment and reasoning, by providing generative AI analysis to the fulfillers and enabling them to identify cases that require urgent attention.

Now Assist Sentiment Analysis uses large language model (LLM) to produce sentiment evaluations for new or active case/problem records, and it also illustrates sentiment trends over time. Fulfillers are provided with a summary to comprehend the reasons behind the sentiments without reading all the notes and comments. This enables them to prioritize and focus on urgent cases and issues based on the severity of the sentiments, and improve the overall customer experience.

# Now Assist Sentiment Analysis refresh

The skill saves the analysis, trends and reasoning on the record and doesn't refresh with page refreshes. LLM calls are made for sentiment refresh when there is a relevant change on that specific record or updates to the input fields defined in the input prompt. The input fields are defined in Now Assist Admin, as parameters for analysing the customer interaction.

# Now Assist conversational solutions skills

# Agile story generation

Breakdown epics and features into stories using Now Assist in the Enterprise Agile Planning (EAP) workspace. Product managers or scrum leads can save time and reduce functional gaps in stories, thereby improving overall quality and productivity.

Video Link

Product managers and scrum leaders typically spend time and effort in creating detailed stories for their epics and features. More often than not, stories that are created manually tend not to be detailed enough, lacking context and complete information. This lack of information impacts the understanding of the requirements by the scrum teams, thereby affecting the quality of the product. Also, manually creating detailed individual stories for each epic takes a significant amount of time.

The Now Assist for Strategic Portfolio Management (SPM) application includes the skills of generative AI that enable product managers and scrum leads to automatically generate context-based stories for their work items. Through the Agile story generation skill, Now Assist provides story recommendations for an epic or a feature using the name, description, Docs content, and any existing stories. Based on the recommendations, you can ask Now Assist to perform one of the following:

- Split a story recommendation into multiple stories.
- Combine multiple story recommendations into one story.
- Generate stories according to its original recommendations.
- Remove any story recommendation.
- Suggest modification of details within the recommendation such as story title, persona, and description.
- Suggest generating a new story recommendation.

Thus, using Now Assist to help generate stories for epics and features, product managers can reduce time spent in creating high-quality stories, while improving the productivity of the overall scrum team.

# Manage duplicate configuration items (CIs)

Use Now Assist to review de-duplication tasks, create de-duplication templates, assign tasks to templates, and run the templates. In every step and choice that you make, the manage duplication CIs skill directs you to the next step according to your selection.

In CMDB Workspace you can open the Now Assist panel, and then select Manage duplicates. Continue to review responses on the Now Assist panel and to select next actions to manage and remediate duplicate CIs.

As you interact with the skill, it guides you to the next step according to your selection. You can review the root cause analysis for the de-duplication tasks. Root cause analysis groups the de-duplication tasks by IRE identification rules (including criterion attributes) and discovery sources. Use that information to prevent further generation of duplicate CIs.

# Task generation in Collaborative Work Management

Save time and significantly reduce manual effort by generating tasks from the context of a Doc page and add them to the Board in Collaborative Work Management (CWM) using Now Assist.

Watch the video

Creating tasks with detailed descriptions for your CWM Board requires significant time and manual effort. If the tasks aren’t detailed enough, it can lead to confusion and misalignment within the team, affecting their understanding of the expected outcomes. To avoid this manual effort and improve time to value, Now Assist can generate tasks for your Board using the information in your Docs. This way, you can ensure clear and comprehensive task descriptions, allowing you to focus more on execution and less on the administrative work.

Based on the recommendations, you can ask Now Assist to perform one of the following:

- Generate tasks according to the initial recommendations.

# Now Assist Topics

Use this skill to create Virtual Agent topics that use large language model (LLM) discovery.

Watch this video to learn about LLM topics in Virtual Agent.

Video Link

Unlike NLU topics, LLMs don't require models, intents, or keywords to be linked to the topic. LLMs can discover topics and perform language-related tasks, such as text generation for case summaries and resolution notes, without months of training on NLU models. The LLM does all of the heavy lifting for you. The only requirement is a robust, plain language topic description. The LLM uses this description to find the best topic match for the user utterance. If there are multiple potential matches, the user will see a list of topics to choose from.

# For more information, see the following topics:

- Now Assist in Virtual Agent
- LLM topic discovery in Virtual Agent
- LLM assistants

# Subflows and actions

Use this skill to create Now Assist topics from Workflow Studio subflows and actions that are conversation-compatible.

Like other Now Assist topics, the LLM requires a robust plain language topic description, which is provided by the action or subflow description and its input hints. The LLM uses this description to find the best subflow or action match for the user utterance. If there are multiple potential matches, the user will see a list of subflows or actions to choose from.

# Dashboard and visualization export skill

Export Platform Analytics dashboards and data visualizations conversationally in the Now Assist panel. Choose output format and destination.

# Dashboard and visualization export skill in Now Assist panel

# Important:

- This Now Assist skill is designed for you to be able to export any dashboard or visualization that you can access. It is also designed for you to be able to schedule the export of any dashboard or visualization that you can access if you have the par_scheduler role or a role that contains par_scheduler.
- You can only select for export dashboards or data visualizations that have been saved to their respective libraries.
- Although you can directly export only visualizations that are in the library, if you export a dashboard, you export all visualizations on that dashboard, including those that were not saved to the library.
- You cannot export technical dashboards, only dashboards that have been created in the in-line dashboard editor.

# Export options

You can export dashboards and data visualizations to PDF or Microsoft PowerPoint files. You can also export data visualizations to PNG or JPEG.

---


# Exporting Dashboards to PowerPoint

Note:

- List, pivot, calendar, and geomap visualizations cannot be exported to PowerPoint.
- By default, you can export a maximum of 150 visualizations in one PowerPoint export.

If you need more slides, consider exporting the dashboard as separate tabs.

When exporting a dashboard to PowerPoint, you can export the entire dashboard or a selection of tabs. If there are filters on the dashboard or tabs, you can have any values set on those filters apply to the PowerPoint export.

You can select from the following file destinations:

- Download
- Email
- Scheduled email

Specify recipients for an email. If you select scheduled email, also specify the frequency of the email. You are asked for more details depending on the frequency you have selected.

Note: If you select Download and the export takes longer than 10 seconds, you receive the export as an email attachment instead of a download. Thus the export completes asynchronously, freeing up the Now Assist panel.

For more information about export options, see these topics:

- Export a Platform Analytics dashboard
- Export a visualization from the Visualization Designer

Tip: When one export has been requested, reset the conversation before requesting another one.

# Guidelines and Example Requests

You can describe the export you want with a variable amount of detail. You are prompted for any necessary information that is missing. Before the export runs, you are asked to review the request, giving you a chance to change any options.

---

Export request review

Here are some example requests with different levels of detail, to use in different circumstances:

- Export this visualization to Powerpoint

If you have a dashboard or data visualization open, you do not have to specify the name. Now Assist is aware of the context. For this request, you would be asked for the export method.
- Export visualization Asset lifecycle by state to PPT

If you do not have the dashboard or visualization open, either specify its name or choose it from the list. Always specify whether you want to export a dashboard or a visualization.
- Export and email Usage Overview dashboard

As there are several dashboards with Usage Overview in the name, you are asked which one to export.

---


# Export to PowerPoint the Reports Usage Tab of the Analytics Usage Overview Dashboard

You can export an entire dashboard or a selected tab to PowerPoint. You can only export entire dashboards to PDF.

# Export this Dashboard to PowerPoint with Applied Filters

In this case, you export the open dashboard and apply any filters on the dashboard as a whole and on any tabs. If you export a dashboard tab with applied filters, you apply only the top-level dashboard filters and the filters on that tab. You can apply filters only when exporting to PowerPoint.

Tip: After an export request is complete, reset the conversation before beginning a new request. Otherwise, some option selections might carry over to the new request. If this happens anyway, consider clearing your browser cache.

# Limitations

Recognition of request content can be intermittent. The more detail you specify in your request, the more likely it is that not all of it will be recognized.

Some prompts are not recognized at all. Avoid the following phrases:

- Mail to me
- Mail with subject and body as Visualization/Dashboard name

# Navigation

Use the navigation skill in Now Assist to take you where you want to go on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

# Overview of Navigation

Navigation is a skill in the Now Assist panel that handles record search requests during a chat. When you ask for records or tables in plain language, Now Assist shows you links in the chat to take you to the best match to your request. For example, you could enter Show me incident records.

# Now Assist Conversational Help

This skill uses Generative AI application capabilities to provide answers to the questions on the Now Assist panel.

Video Link

The Now Assist Conversational Help skill displays as Get Help on the Now Assist panel.

Note: The Get Help feature is available as a part of Now Assist entitlements and no new subscription is required. The feature is enabled by default and you can turn it off in the Now Assist Admin Settings. The ServiceNow Now LLM Service (Large Language Model) is the default model provider for this Now Assist skill to retrieve precise answers to the users' questions.

# You can ask your question in two ways:

- Select Get Help skill and submit a query to use the help option in the Now Assist panel.
- Submit your query directly in the Now Assist panel. It will perform discovery and find the most appropriate skill among the listed, based on the keywords you entered. This discovered skill is used to retrieve answers for your queries.

Note: The available skills displayed in the Now Assist panel can be customized in consultation with the integration teams.

# How Conversational Help works

Your query goes through the following steps to retrieve the best response.

1. AI search

The query is sent to a central ServiceNow instance, where AI Search will search the knowledge table that stores content from product doc content.

We use Instance Data Replication (IDR) synchronizes product documentation content from Now Support instances.

Note: Multiple central ServiceNow instances are deployed across three regions: US East or US West, EMEA, and APJC.



---

# 2. The top matching chunks (or records) along with the user’s query, are sent to the Now Assist Q&#x26;A Genius Result configuration to generate a meaningful, contextual answer.

# 3. Re-ranking

The Now Assist Q&#x26;A, an out of box (OOB) capability, re-ranks the retrieved chunks to ensure better relevance.

# 4. Cache lookup

- If the user query exists in the cache, the pre-stored answer is returned.
- If the query is not cached, the query and re-ranked chunks are sent to Now LLM to generate a meaningful answer.

The Now LLM retrieves the most relevant result from https://www.servicenow.com/docs/portal and displays it in the same panel.

Note: Effective from this release, the query will retrieve results based exclusively on the release version of the user's current instance. This enhancement is integrated into the query process to ensure the delivery of precise results that reflect the latest updates and features.

# Now Assist Guardian

Enable Now Assist Guardian, built with ServiceNow Small Language Model, to monitor and evaluate content created with generative AI to help protect and enhance the user experience.

# Now Assist Guardian Overview

Generative AI is an emerging technology. Human interactions are unpredictable, and outputs generated by large language model (LLM) are probabilistic, which means that they're based on probabilities. Running the same input twice may generate two different outputs. Managing risk is an important element of deciding how you want to implement generative AI on your instances.

Now Assist Guardian monitors requests sent to LLMs and their responses to help protect you, your users, and your data. There are three types of content that are monitored for: offensive or harmful content, prompt injection attempts, and filtered subjects. For offensive content and prompt injection attempts, logs are generated if activated, but you can also choose to block the content. When a filter has been activated, detected content that the filter applies to will redirect the user to the Sensitivity Detection: Fallback topic in Virtual Agent.

# Guardrails

# Offensive content

Due to the probabilistic nature of generative AI, it's possible for an LLM to generate offensive content. If there's offensive content in the input of the request, offensive content can also occur in the response. Examples of offensive content include language that is toxic, defamatory, or fraudulent.

# Prompt injection

Prompt injection is a type of security attack where bad actors override the normal instructions of an LLM to access restricted information or elicit unexpected behaviors. Prompt injection detection is based on the LLM which has been trained on various types of prompt injection techniques such as role playing, paraphrasing, repetition, instructions to ignore other instructions, persuasion, etc. However, due to the probabilistic nature of the model as well as evolving prompt injection techniques, prompt injection attempts may not be identified by Now Assist Guardian in some cases.

# Filtered subjects

Certain subjects, such as workplace safety or employee compensation, might not be best suited for generative AI conversations. You can activate filters that detect if these kinds of subjects are included in the conversation so that you can redirect the user to the Sensitivity Detection: Fallback Virtual Agent topic.

---


# Logging and blocking

Now Assist Guardian can monitor requests and can log when these kinds of material are detected. You can access logs from the Now Assist Admin console in the Now Assist Guardian page of the Settings tab. Data included in the logs include information about the request and the conversation that contains the offensive content, including user feedback.

Besides logging, you can also choose to block offensive content or prompt injection attempts. If the material is detected and blocking is turned on, you see a standard error message instead of the generated response. The message is a standard error message indicating that the request couldn’t be completed, and you don't see what the AI generated.

Before deciding to block content, you can monitor logs for some time to determine how prevalent these issues are for you and your use cases.

# Redirection for sensitive filtered topics

Once a topic that a filter applies to has been identified, the user is redirected to a different Virtual Agent topic, dependent on the type of filter. Filters for subjects like employee personal issues will redirect to the Sensitivity Detection: Fallback topic. This topic can redirect a user to a live agent or help them create an HR case.

Users also have the option to override the redirection by selecting Proceed, not sensitive, which returns them to their original topic without initiating the fallback flow.

Note: Once the user continues with the fallback topic, for example, by beginning the flow to create an HR case, the Virtual Agent does not continue detecting sensitive topics within that conversation.

# Now Assist Guardian at runtime

All skills that use Now Assist Guardian remove personally identifiable information (PII) before the request reaches the LLM. You can choose what kinds of data are caught. See Configuring Now Assist for Data Privacy for more information.

For conversational skills, semantic search processes requests to determine whether a filter has been detected. If so, the user is redirected to a Virtual Agent topic that asks if they want to make an HR case or speak to a live agent.

For catalog item generation and agent skills like summarization and resolution note generation, offensiveness and prompt injection guardrails are run on inputs and outputs of requests. If either is detected, Now Assist Guardian logs the request. If you’ve chosen to block this content, then a standard error message appears, and the user doesn’t see the result of the request.

# Translation for Now Assist

There are two translation services available for user-generated content that you can use to speak to users in their preferred language in Now Assist applications.

# Translation overview

You can configure two different translation services for Now Assist applications to communicate with your users in their preferred languages. Both translation services detect the language used based on the user's language choice in their Language &#x26; Region preferences or the contents of the text, such as a conversation message.

For Dynamic Translation, once non-English content is detected, the translation service translates the content to English before sending the request to the large language model (LLM). After the LLM returns a response, the response is translated back into the user's preferred language for them to see. For example, a user enters a message in Slovenian. Dynamic Translation translates the Slovenian to English before giving the message to the LLM. The LLM generates a response in English, and then Dynamic Translation translates that response to Slovenian to show to the user.

For native translation, text is sent as-is to the model and the model responds in the user's language. For example, if a user sends a message in Spanish, the multi-lingual LLM supports Spanish, so it receives the Spanish input directly from the user. It then generates a response in Spanish, regardless of the language used in the source material it uses to create that response.

If you enable both Dynamic Translation and native translation, native translation has preference and is used first.

If you have native translation enabled, the LLM checks the user's language to see if it is supported. If the language is supported, only native translation is used and no Dynamic Translation occurs. A small number of languages are not yet natively supported by all models. Now Assist Dynamic Translation is automatically applied to address this for unsupported languages. Additionally, if you have native translation enabled, then LLM requests that return outputs in the fallback language will not be translated by Dynamic Translation. They’ll be returned as-is to the user. This process helps increase skill performance and decrease latency.

# General guidelines for writing instructions for generative AI large language models (LLMs)

When using Now Assist products and skills, you may have the option to give specific instructions or other guidance to the LLM. Writing generative AI instructions is different from conducting a keyword search. Use the following general guidelines when crafting your instructions.

Writing instructions for generative AI is very different from using search keywords. Keywords are the words that you might expect to appear in your results. For example, if you search for "gray bobtail cats," then you can reasonably expect your search results to return with topics or media that is about gray cats, bobtail cats, or even just cats in general. But with generative AI, you are asking the LLM to perform a task for you. The phrase "gray bobtail cats" does not include a verb to tell the LLM what to do. What about these gray cats? Should it locate all there is to know about them? Should it find gray bobtail cats to adopt? Should it create a picture of a gray bobtail cat? Should it be a realistic picture, or more of a line drawing? Generative AI needs more than just keywords.

# General LLM instructions

Use instructions or questions to tell the LLM what you want. They can include four parts:

- Goal

What kind of result do you want from the LLM?

Example: I want a list of 3-5 bullet points to prepare me...
- Context

Why do you need it, and who is involved?

Example: ...for an upcoming meeting with [client], focusing on their current state and what they're looking to achieve with their "Phase 3+" brand campaign.
- Expectations

How should the LLM best fulfill your request?

Example: Please use simple language so I can get up to speed quickly.
- Source

What information or other resources would you like the LLM to use?

Example: Focus on email and Teams chats with [people] since June.

Sample LLM instructions

Continually test and refine your instructions. Creating good LLM instructions is an iterative process, and as the LLM model learns, you may want to modify your instructions over time.

# Stating your goal

When constructing an LLM description or instruction, consider these basic guidelines.

- Lead with action verbs. Use the imperative form or direct commands.
- Be direct and use simple sentences rather than complex ones.
- Be specific.
- Don't use jargon or slang terms.
- Avoid references to third parties or pronouns. Removing the subject or any identifiers generally prevents the LLM from personifying or otherwise misidentifying the end user.
- Your words instruct the logic that generative AI will use. Detailed, chain-of-thought instructions work well for this.

Instructions should also be tailored to the type of task. The following table describes the different kinds of tasks and the sort of instructions you might write for each circumstance.

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Task type</td>
<td>Description</td>
<td>Example instruction</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Simple search</td>
<td>Simple search for an answer.</td>
<td>When is the next company holiday?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Answer</td>
<td>Gather information from multiple sources and provide a summarized answer.</td>
<td>What were the major customer support issues in the past 30 days?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Chat</td>
<td>A back-and-forth conversation in which the LLM is getting additional information from the requester.</td>
<td>I have a new phone and now I can’t access Okta.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Create</td>
<td>Create a new ServiceNow component.</td>
<td>Write a new KB on common reasons for slow query execution and how to fix it, based on problems created in the last 12 months.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Workflow</td>
<td>Leverage existing workflows and create conversations from them.</td>
<td>Reset my Okta password.</td>
</tr>

# LLM instruction workflow

Providing context in your instructions

Providing context to the LLM may feel like you are stating the obvious. For example, you may need to explain why your user would want to perform the task, or explain more about what the task is about. If you're using language that could have alternative meanings, you may want to define your terms. For example, if your instructions are about Microsoft Teams, you may need to say something like, "Teams refers to Microsoft Teams, an application that employees in a company can use to communicate with one another individually or in groups."

When providing context, think about the target audience for the task. This will help you to write better instructions. Mentioning whom the task is for also helps the LLM carry out the task.

# Types of users to consider:

- Admins
Admins configure skills in the Now Assist Admin console. They work with platform owners and product owners for tasks and requirements. Subject-matter experts check the accuracy of generative AI results. Governance boards or committees may oversee final sign-off on the skill.
- Builders
Builders create assets such as applications and workflows. Their skill level may vary from no-code, low-code, mid-skill, or high-skill. They mostly interact with each other and admins.
- Agents
Agents provide technical assistance, customer support, or other problem-solving help for users of a product, service, or organization. Agents work with their peers and support many kinds of requesters.
- Requesters
Requesters may include your organization's employees, partners, or customers. Requesters encounter generative AI mostly in a self-service context. Generative AI provides the opportunity to requesters to solve the problem themselves before they resort to asking an agent for help.

# In addition, you may need to "instruct" the LLM how to arrive at the kind of answer you want.

Detailed chain-of-thought instructions are more likely to produce the results you're looking for. If you make assumptions in your instructions, your results may vary wildly.

# Example of chain-of-thought instructions

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Standard instructions</td>
<td>Chain-of-thought instructions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Q: Start with 5 tennis balls. Buy 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls are there now?</td>
<td>Q: Start with 5 tennis balls. Buy 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls are there now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A: The answer is 11.</td>
<td>A: There are 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5+6=11. The answer is 11.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If the cafeteria used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples does the cafeteria have?</td>
<td>Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If the cafeteria used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples does the cafeteria have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A: The answer is 27.</td>
<td>A: The cafeteria had 23 apples originally. They used 20 to make lunch. So they had 23-20=3. They bought 6 more apples, so they have 3+6=9. The answer is 9.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

# Expectations

You can specify how you want your results to sound and look. For example, you can tell the LLM what kind of tone you want it to use.

# Modifying the tone of LLM results

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Instruction</td>
<td>LLM result</td>
<td>Evaluation of result</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Greet the user with a casual, laid-back tone.</td>
<td>Hey there! (: Welcome to May 22, 2024, a Wednesday. Chill and have a great day!</td>

<td>Greet the user with a professional, business-like tone.</td>
<td>Good day, welcome to our business. How may I assist you today?</td>
<td>A little too formal.</td>

<td>Hello! I'm here to help. How can I assist you today?</td>
<td>Perfect.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

# Instruction

In some Now Assist applications, you may have the option to specify formatting. In those cases, you can tell the LLM to provide answers in a bulleted list, for example. Bulleted lists are often easier to read.

---


# Enabling bulleted list results in the chat summarization skill

Source

You can suggest a variety of sources that the LLM should use to find answers, including Microsoft Teams conversations, Microsoft SharePoint Online sites, incidents and cases, and internal knowledge articles. In order for an agent or skill to access all of these sources, an admin must configure access on the instance.

For developers, the sources that a skill or AI agent can access may vary depending on the desired outcome. For example, the incident summarization skill uses the Incident table as its source. AI agents use different tools and knowledge sources, customized for the task they perform.

For more information about configuring sources for skill or AI agent use, see the following topic areas:

- AI Search
- Now Assist in AI Search
- External Content Connectors

# Multi-language support for Now Assist applications

When dynamic translation in the Generative AI Controller is enabled, your users' input text is handled by Microsoft Azure OEM (com.snc.microsoft_oem_translation_spoke) as follows:

1. The language of the text is detected.
2. The text is dynamically translated to English, then provided to Now Assist.
3. Now Assist returns a response in English.
4. The English response is translated to the user's preferred language and displayed in the UI.

For more information about enabling dynamic translation in this context, see Multilingual service for Now Assist applications and Enable Dynamic Translation for capabilities in Generative AI Controller.

# Activation

The Microsoft Azure OEM translator service is included with Generative AI Controller. Microsoft Azure OEM requires Dynamic Translation tables, so Generative AI Controller activates Dynamic Translation if it isn't already active.

Microsoft Azure OEM appears as a row in the Translator Configurations (sn_dt_translator_configuration) table. This record is not editable. The connection credentials of this translator service are already configured. For more information about this integration, see this link.

If you try to update this record in the Translator Configurations table, the following error is displayed: "The Microsoft Azure OEM translator configuration is used in Generative AI flows. It cannot be edited".

# Activate offensiveness protection for generative AI

Turn on offensiveness protection to log and add the option to block offensive content in AI-generated text and conversations.

# Before you begin

Role required: sn_generative_ai.nsa_admin

# About this task

Generative AI is probabilistic, which means that outputs are based on probabilities, and using the same input twice does not guarantee the same output. Some of the material generated by AI could potentially be undesirable because of toxicity, sexism, or other offensive sentiment. Now Assist Guardian enables you to log any material that is detected to be offensive. If you choose, you can also block offensive material so that users don't see the generated content. Instead, they see a message stating that offensive material has been detected and blocked.

See Now Assist Guardian for more information.

Logs can be exported for review. For instructions on how to do so, see Export Now Assist Guardian logs.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > Now Assist Admin > Settings.
2. In the side panel, select the Now Assist Guardian > Offensiveness tab.

If you have any offensiveness guardrails already activated, they appear in the Active tab.

# 4. Select Activate for the workflow that you want to enable offensiveness protection on.

# 5. Select your impact detection.

Now Assist Guardian logs when offensive content is detected or generated when offensiveness protection is activated. You can also choose whether you want to block the content from the user. If you choose to block the content, the user sees a standardized message explaining that offensive material has been blocked instead of what was generated.

# 6. Select Save.

# Result

Now Assist Guardian's offensiveness guardrail is enabled on your instance for the workflow you have selected.

# What to do next

You can enable offensiveness protection for all Now Assist applications that you have enabled on your instance. If you want to change your detection impact, you can select more options ( ) in the list of active workflows and choose Edit.

You can deactivate offensiveness protection for your workflow at any time by selecting more options and choosing Deactivate.

# Configure prompt injection attack protection

# Now Assist Value Insights

Gain insights into the value realized from Now Assist skills and features.

The Now Assist value insights dashboard page gives you insights into the estimated productivity gains as a result of using Now Assist skills. The productivity gains are classified into two categories: Estimated Writing Time Saved and Estimated Reading Time Saved. Data points and timestamps from the invoking records are captured and used to perform calculations and approximations for the read and write time saved by users using Now Assist. See Now Assist Analytics dashboard indicator details for information on the data and calculations behind each indicator.

# Estimated Writing Time Saved Indicators

Now Assist skills that contribute to improving writing efficiency and saving time include Knowledge Base generation, resolution notes generation, and incident and case creation triggered from chat summarization. Writing time saved is an estimation of the time that the user would have otherwise had to spend writing Knowledge articles, resolution notes, incident, and case details.

Note: The following formula is used to calculate the estimated writing time saved: (Word count of the LLM-generated response)/(Write rate). For example, if the resolution notes generated by the LLM response has 180 words, the estimated writing time saved is 180/40, which is 4.5 minutes. The calculations are based on an assumption that the LLM-generated response is accepted in its entirety by the user. The write rate considered for the calculations is based on the industry average for write rate, which is 40 words per minute. To set a value according to your requirements, add a system property by the name sn_na_analytics.wts.rate and set the value accordingly. For more information on adding a system property, see Add a system property.

# Estimated Reading Time Saved

The Now Assist skills that contributed to improving reading efficiency and saving time include record summarization (incident, case, and change request) and chat summarization.

Note: The following formula is used to calculate the estimated reading time saved:

(Word count of the contents of a record - word count of the LLM-generated summary of the record)/(Read rate). Short description, description, priority, state, and activities in the metadata record constitute the contents of a record. For example, if the contents of a case record contains 420 words and the case summary generated by the LLM contains 180 words, the estimated read time saved is (420-180)/240, which is 1 minute. The read rate considered for the calculations is based on the industry average for read rate, which is 240 words per minute. To set a value according to your requirements, add a system property by the name sn_na_analytics.rts.rate and set the value accordingly. For more information on adding a system property, see Add a system property.

# Estimated reading time saved indicators

The indicators on the Estimated Reading Time Saved dashboard page provide the following insights.

# Groups

None.

# Special considerations

None.

# User data usage policy for Now Assist

Now Assist is designed to keep user data safe and secure. You can also mask sensitive data or opt-out of sharing data for model improvements.

# How your data is sent and stored

Your AI workloads are securely sent using Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 from your ServiceNow instance to one of three centralized ServiceNow compute hubs (datacenters with GPUs for AI workloads), where the AI prediction processing takes place. The data used to generate the response is deleted from the compute hubs after the response has been generated. The result is then returned to the ServiceNow instance.

The input and output data isn’t cached or stored on the compute hub and is transient.

Your data isn’t commingled with other customer data when using Now LLM Service for generative AI.

Also, there’s no commingling of data for domain-separated instances when you use Generative AI services.

When appropriate, ServiceNow might leverage third-party endpoint services (for example Azure OpenAI Service) to augment Now LLM Service to power Now Assist capabilities. Further, to confirm quality of service, ServiceNow might use Azure-hosted GPUs for Now LLM Service capacity bursting in case of high customer demand. Data processed by third-party endpoints isn’t subject to use or access by third-party providers and are operated within the ServiceNow network boundary.

# Mask sensitive data

Sensitive data can be masked before sending it to LLMs using Now Assist for Data Privacy. To learn more, see Configuring Now Assist for Data Privacy.

After you enable the plugin, it’s designed to mask sensitive data before it’s sent to the LLM, but could result in less accurate results because the specific data isn’t included within the prompt.

Note: This plugin, within the context of generative AI products, doesn’t mask the sensitive data that exists in records within your instance, nor does it help prevent new sensitive data from being stored on the instance itself.

ServiceNow might use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for selected AI features (for example NowAssist for AI Search) and passes information to the LLM based on what the requester can access within the system. If a user searches for something in the portal using Now Assist in AI Search, AI Search finds the article and then sends that to the LLM as a part of the prompt. Because AI Search knows what the user has access to, it won't send an article that the user isn't able to access.

Note: For some features, such as case summarization, the agent generating the summary might have more permissions than other people who have access to the record. If they choose to paste that summary to the work notes, the agent should check to confirm that the data they're sharing in the work notes is appropriate to share with others who have access to that record.

# Opt out of data sharing

Data Sharing helps ServiceNow to continuously advance and improve its Now LLMs, based on the latest customer usage. If you no longer want to participate in the customer data-sharing program, you’re able to opt out.

To opt out, follow the instructions in Opt out of data sharing for Now Assist.

# Domain separation in the Now Assist Admin console

Domain separation is supported for the Now Assist Admin console. Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data.

Support level: Basic

- Business logic: Ensure that data goes into the proper domain for the application’s service provider use cases.
- The application supports domain separation at run time. The domain separation includes separation from the user interface, cache keys, reporting, rollups, and aggregations.
- The owner of the instance must set up the application to function across multiple tenants.

Sample use case: When a service provider (SP) uses chat to respond to a tenant-customer’s message, the customer must be able to see the SP's response.

For more information on support levels, see Application support for domain separation.

# How domain separation works in the Now Assist Admin console

You must enable domain separation on your instance first before you can use it for Now Assist skills.

Now Assist works with domain separation. When you use Now Assist in a domain-separated environment, users are only able to access data within their domain. For example, if a user uses the summarization skill, Now Assist only uses material that exists within the user's domain when generating that summary. When a skill is domain separated, only users who are in that domain can use the skill that you have configured for that scope.

If you're a service provider that hosts multiple clients in the same instance, you can set up domain separation to separate tenant data, processes, and administrative tasks. However, Assist consumption is tracked according to instance without differentiating between tenants. You can track your Now Assist usage in the Subscription Management dashboard.



---



# Use cases

You can configure the inputs, roles, triggers, and prompts when you’re activating or editing a skill or a later variant of the skill.

Some use cases include the following examples:

- Use the Activity field as an input in the incident summarization in one domain but only use the short description and description fields in another domain.
- Grant certain roles access to the Now Assist panel in one domain while another domain has no role restrictions.
- Trigger the generative AI capabilities by using quick actions in Agent Chat in only one domain.
- Create a variant of a skill to test one prompt in one domain while another domain uses the default prompt for the skill.

# Granting a domain access to Now Assist skills

Domain separation is possible at the skill level and at the individual configuration level. When using the guided setup in the Now Assist Admin console, each configuration option has its own record that you can separate by domain. To create a record in a different domain, you must set up the skill while in the scope of your preferred domain.

1. Navigate to the Now Assist Skill Config (sn_nowassist_skill_config) table.
2. Add the Domain field to the list. If it isn't present, select the gear icon at the top of the list and add the Domain field into the Selected column, then select OK.
3. Find the skill that you want to enable on a domain-by-domain basis. Set Active to false on the skill that is in the global scope. You might need to change the scope to edit the record.
4. Change your current domain to the domain that you want to enable the skill in.
5. Navigate to All > Now Assist Admin Console > Features.
6. Navigate to the skill that you want to activate according to domain and select Activate skill.
7. Configure the skill as usual. For more information, see Activate a Now Assist skill.
8. Return to the Now Assist Skill Config (sn_nowassist_skill_config) table. There should be a new record in the current domain. Open the new record.
9. In a different browser tab, return to the Now Assist Skill Config table and open the deactivated skill record in the global domain.
10. Compare the global skill record to the one created within your domain. Records on the related list may not be present in the domain-specific skill. If they are not there, you must recreate those records in your domain and attach them to the related list in your domain-specific skill.
11. Repeat the process for each skill and each domain where you want to have the skill available.

Fetch end points in Now Assist Conversational Help skills

The Now Assist Conversational Help skills architecture solves latency by fetching answers hosted at the nearest location, which is best suited to the user.

# Fetching solutions hosted on multiple geographical location

The possible solutions to users queries posted on Now Assist Conversational Help skills are hosted on three main locations: Japan, EMEA and the US.

For optimal performance, the central instance should be situated in the same geographic area as the user's instance. To achieve this alignment, we utilize DISH service, a tool within the user's instance, that helps identify the correct endpoint. The Now Assist Conversational Help skills uses the Mimir lookup service feature, inside the different data centers.

The DISH service communicates with the Mimir lookup table to determine the end points matching the user's location. Once we obtain this endpoint, it gets securely stored in the sys-service table within the customer instance. Moving forward, all the users' queries are routed through the specific endpoint, ensuring consistency and reliability. The Get Help skill uses the endpoint present in the sys-property com.snc.get_help.endpoint.

Note: The Now Assist Conversational Help skill version is stored in sn_ads_now_help.com.snc_now_help_skill.version, ensuring backward compatibility within the conversational shared services.

# Performance Analytics indicators for generative AI

Indicators for generative AI include information about generative AI logs, executions, tokens, latency, number of users who use a Now Assist skill, and more.

These indicators can be found by going to the Analytics Hub. To access the Analytics Hub, navigate to Performance Analytics > Analytics Hub. There are two sets of indicators, one for the Generative AI Log table and one for the Generative AI Usage Log table. Both can be accessed by searching for gen ai.

These indicators measure data on daily intervals. Data is only available for dates before the current date. If you want to see results from the current day, you must wait until the next day.

# Generative AI Log table Indicators

Generative AI logs on your instance provide details for generative AI executions on the instance. All indicators can be broken down by definition and skill config so you can keep track of the executions of LLM requests on your instance.

- Total Gen AI Logs
- Breakdowns: By Definition, By Skill Config, By Status, By Feedback

# Integration with Now Assist Virtual Agent for User Context

For the users of Now Assist, Knowledge Graph integrates the context from the prebuilt User Profile Schemas that provide personalized responses.

By leveraging relationships between users, teams, and content, products like AI Search and Now Assist can provide relevant, permission-aware answers instead of generic results.

With Knowledge Graph, responses are dynamically tailored based on:

- Who the user is: Role, department, and location
- Who they collaborate with: Manager, reportee
- What assets do they have

Here’s an example use case:

# Integration with Now Assist Virtual Agent for Slot filling

An employee uses Now Assist Virtual Agent for information on parental leave policy. They enter the query in the Virtual Agent window What is my parental leave policy?

Virtual Agent receives the user information like. The employee is based in the country: USA, state: California, City: Santa Clara, from the Knowledge Graph User Profile Schema.

This additional user profile context is used to personalize the synthesized response to the exact location of the employee.

Therefore, instead of getting a link to the parental leave policy document or a generic response, the employee gets a tailored contextualized answer:

Your company offers a generous parental leave policy to its employees in California. As of January 2022, the company increased paid time off for workers who give birth to a maximum of 24 weeks from the previous 18. In addition to the company's internal policies, California state law provides further protections. The California Family Rights Act (CFRA) offers eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to care for their own serious health condition or that of a family member, or to bond with a new child. This is complemented by the Pregnancy Disability Leave (PDL) law, which provides up to four months of unpaid, job-protected leave for employees disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.

Knowledge Graph enhances the Virtual Agent user experience and makes the process seamless and efficient by reducing the slot-filling questions asked during conversations.

Here’s an example use case:

An employee uses Virtual Agent to request a laptop replacement. Virtual Agent uses the assigned Knowledge Graph schema to find information and resolve the query with minimal user inputs.

# Virtual Agent Query Process

1. The user uses Virtual Agent to query Need assistance in laptop replacement.
2. Virtual Agent processes the query and generates the following prompts required for this request:
- Topic: New laptop request
- Name
- Location
- Department
- Laptop model
- Address
3. Virtual Agent first tries to gather this information using Knowledge Graph.
4. The Knowledge Graph schema leverages LLM to retrieve the data from all the relevant entities, called nodes using the relationship between these nodes, called edges, and provides the following output:
- Topic: New laptop request
- Name: John Doe
- Location: Santa Clara
- Department: Marketing

# Badge Template: User input needed

Address: 123 Street, CA, USA

1. Virtual Agent requests verification of the output and add details for the missing fields.
2. The user can edit and verify the provided information before confirming. Once confirmed, the request is processed with minimal effort from the user.
3. Virtual Agent processes the user input and completes the user query.

Knowledge Graph leverages the existing information available in the internal databases and auto-populates it to reduce the efforts while making the entire experience seamless.

# Integration with Now Assist Virtual Agent for people queries

Now Assist Virtual Agent can now provide users with information about people in your organization.

If you ask Virtual Agent about a person, the information about that person you're searching for appears in the synthesized response, along with an inline people citation.

Inline citations appear at the end of the relevant synthesized response sentence. Selecting an inline citation results in a popover containing either a link to an article or source, or a description and action to start the action.

Note: Shared files only appear if Knowledge Graph admin has activated the sn_kg_conn_user_shared_files record in Knowledge Graph related data map [sn_kg_related_data_map_list] table. To activate it, set the Active field to True.

# Integration with AI agents as a tool

Knowledge Graph can now be used as a tool within AI agents. Users can choose Knowledge Graph to perform tasks, while creating an Agent.

You can define the flow action to use Knowledge Graph as a reusable operation in automating the ServiceNow AI Platform features without having to write code.

See Add a Knowledge Graph to an AI agent to add Knowledge Graph to an AI agents in AI Agent Studio.

# Example use case:

- A user wants to view and retire all the assets assigned to another user. To execute this task, user will use Asset Manager agent.
- Asset Manager uses Knowledge Graph to fetch the asset information related to the user.
- After processing the query, the agent provides the following output: User has the following assets: 1.<asset1> 2.<asset2> 3.- <asset 3=""> . The email address for the user is <emailid> and username <username1>.</username1></emailid></purchase></asset></productid></asset2></asset1>
- User then proceeds with the task of retiring the assets: Proceed with retiring the assets associated with Username1.
- The next tool, used to execute this task, will take the table name and sysId displayed in Knowledge Graph output and proceed with the task.

# Example: Knowledge Graph API output in AI agents

When a user asks a query What is my Manager's name?, AI agents reach out to Knowledge Graph to fetch this information. Here's an example output of the query:

{
"Manager": [
{
"sys_user": {
"user_name": {
"value": "abel.tuter",
"displayValue": "abel.tuter"
},

Using Knowledge Graph Designer

Use Knowledge Graph Designer to create customized Knowledge Graph schemas that consist of nodes and edges.

Knowledge Graph schemas are the customized Knowledge graphs that consist of nodes and edges.

Like tables, nodes also denote and store details about entities such as user, location, department. You can add nodes to the Knowledge Graph schema so that the system can reach out to all the relevant tables to fetch the data. You can also edit node properties such as data source, start node, end node, and connected nodes.

Knowledge Graph enables you to select the node columns that can be queried.

The relationship or connections between these nodes are referred to as edges. You can select and edit the connecting edges and available edges for each node.

With Knowledge Graph Designer, you can create, edit, duplicate, or delete a Knowledge Graph schema.

There’s an option to test a Knowledge Graph schema by generating and running a query.

# View Knowledge Graph schemas

By default, ServiceNow published Knowledge Graph schemas are available with the product. View the prebuilt schemas provided by ServiceNow, or the schemas created by your organization admin. There are currently two prebuilt schemas available that are read-only but can be cloned and edited:

1. User profile schema
2. HRSD schema (available only if you have the Now Assist for HRSD plugin)

# User profile schema

The User profile schema is the default schema that is used for passing the in-session user profile context to the OOTB integration with Virtual Agent for Context. This integration helps with personalized responses.

This schema details the attributes related to a user and comprises the following details:

# User Profile Schema

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Schema</th>
<th>Attributes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>sys_user</td>
<td> &lt;ul> &lt;li>name&lt;/li> &lt;li>first name&lt;/li> &lt;li>last name&lt;/li> &lt;li>user name&lt;/li> &lt;li>employee number&lt;/li> &lt;li>email&lt;/li> &lt;li>business phone&lt;/li> &lt;li>mobile phone&lt;/li> &lt;li>title&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> </td>

# Domain separation and Generative AI Controller

Domain separation is supported for Generative AI Controller. Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data.

# Support level: Standard

- Includes all aspects of Basic level support.
- Application properties are domain-aware as needed.
- Business logic: The service provider (SP) creates or modifies processes per customer. The use cases reflect proper use of the application by multiple SP customers in a single instance.
- The instance owner must configure the minimum viable product (MVP) business logic and data parameters per tenant as expected for the specific application.

# Sample use case:

An admin must be able to make comments required when a record closes for one tenant, but not for another.

For more information on support levels, see Application support for domain separation.

# Domain Separation in Generative AI Controller

Domain separation enables you to create partitions in the application data and administrative processes. Because the generative AI tables are domain separated, Generative AI Controller supports domain separation for OneExtend capabilities. The capabilities are the basic building blocks for Virtual Agent Designer topics, components, flows, and scripts that use generative AI. With domain separation, you can isolate the data and control access so that users in one domain don’t have access to the capabilities of another domain.

For more details on domain separation and Virtual Agent, check out the documentation.

# How Domain Separation Works in Generative AI Controller

Domain separation is possible at the generative AI OneExtend capability level. Records that are related to the execution and configuration of OneExtend capabilities, such as log tables that are accessible to ServiceNow personnel, are also separated according to the capability's domain.

If you want to create a copy of an existing generative AI capability in a different domain, you must create a record in the OneExtend Capabilities (sys_one_extend_capability) table. See the reference for Generative AI Controller for more information about the OneExtend Capabilities table.

You set the domain when the record is created. The domain is based on the domain that you're in at the time that you create the record. When you're creating a capability record, you can use an existing OneExtend Capability record as a blueprint to help confirm that the capability works as intended.

After you create the OneExtend Capability record, you must create records for the following attribute and config records in the new domain:

- OneExtend Capability Attribute records with the same values as the capability in the global domain.
- A OneExtend Capability Definition that corresponds to the new capability.
- A OneExtend Definition Config definition record that includes the OneExtend Capability Definition for the new domain.

For more information on setting up OneExtend Definition Configs to use in Virtual Agent Designer, see enabling Generative AI Controller for Virtual Agent.

You can also create these records by using the related lists in the OneExtend Capability record default view.

Note: The OneExtend Capability Definition record that you add must be the same as the capability that you want in the new domain. For example, if you’re creating a capability in a new domain for sentiment analysis, you could add the Sentiment Analysis (OpenAI Completion) record. Adding the Summarize (OpenAI Completion) Config could result in unexpected behavior. The OneExtend Definition Config record that you select should include the OneExtend Capability Definition record that you added.

# Use Cases

With domain-separated capabilities, you can build different Virtual Agent topics, flows with Workflow Studio, or different background and business rule scripts that are also domain separated.

template. For example, if you're configuring a Summarize capability, your prompt template could be Summarize the following for me in a friendly and helpful tone: {{textToSummarize}}. To learn which attributes are available to include in the prompt, go to the OneExtend Capability [sys_one_extend_capability] table, find the record for the capability you're configuring, and look at the OneExtend Capability Attributes related list.

You might need to experiment with different prompts to determine what works best for your use cases.

2. In the navigation filter, go to the Generative AI Custom LLM Transformer [sys_generative_ai_custom_llm_transformer] table by entering sys_generative_ai_custom_llm_transformer.
3. Select New.
4. Write transformer scripts.

To have Generative AI Controller understand the format of the inputs and outputs of your custom LLM, you must write transformer scripts. When you create a transformer record, code and comments are provided for you to use as a guide while you edit. These scripts depend on the expected request and response objects that are interpreted by your model.

For example, the Azure OpenAI request structure looks like the following script:

{"messages": [{"role":"user", "content":"Summarize the following text: &#x3C;<content>>"}], "max_tokens": 800, "temperature": 0.7}</content>

The request transformer script for that request structure is the following script:

# Enable recursive summarization for large inputs

Use recursive summarization to break down the requests to the large language models (LLMs) into smaller pieces so that you can maintain the context for generative AI capabilities.

# Before you begin

Role required: admin

# About this task

LLMs have a maximum number of tokens that can be processed in a single request. Certain fields, such as activity fields, can have more information than can fit in within those restrictions. Recursive summarization breaks the information given to an LLM into chunks, summarizes each chunk individually, and then processes the original request with the summarized chunks. The chunks are organized with overlaps between the pieces so that the context is retained across every piece.

Note: Enabling recursive summarization may cause the capabilities to process large inputs more slowly because they must make multiple calls to the LLM instead of just one call.

# Procedure

1. In the navigator filter, go to the OneExtend Capability list by entering sys_one_extend_capability.list.
2. Open the record for the OneExtend capability that you want to change.
3. In the OneExtend Definition Config related list, set Enable Large Input Support to true for the OneExtend Definition that you want to enable recursive summarization for.
4. In the OneExtend Capability Attributes related list, set Contains Large Input to true for the fields that you want to add recursive summarization in. The fields that are most likely to contain a large amount of data, such as an activities field, should have their values set to true. You can also select the Contains Large Input check box on the OneExtend Capability Attribute record and save the record to set the value to true.

# Result

Recursive summarization is enabled for the OneExtend Capability for the fields specified in this procedure.

# Use a script with Generative AI Controller

Use background scripts and Generative AI Controller Generic Prompt to interact directly with the generative AI model API.

# Before you begin

You must be on Vancouver patch 2 or above to script with sn_one_extend.OneExtendUtil objects.

# Role required: admin

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > System Definition > Scripts - Background.
2. Create the text content for a Generic Prompt by creating a request array with a singular executionRequests object.
3. Inside the executionRequests, add the payload and capabilityID attributes. The capabilityID is the sys_id of the capability on the OneExtend Capabilities (sys_one_extend_capability) table, such as Generic Prompt.
4. Add the required inputs as attributes in the payload object.

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Capability</th>
<th>Required attributes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Generic Prompt</td>
<td>&lt;code>prompt&lt;/code>: Prompt for the generative AI to respond to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Generate Content</td>
<td>&lt;code>topic&lt;/code>: Subject for content generation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sentiment Analysis</td>
<td>&lt;code>utterance&lt;/code>: Text to analyze for user sentiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Summarize</td>
<td>&lt;code>textToSummarize&lt;/code>: Topic for the AI to generate a summary.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

The following is an example request array for the Generic Prompt capability.

var request = {
"executionRequests": [
{
"payload": {
"prompt": "Can you act like my business partner and give me some advice on a pitch?"
},
"capabilityId": "0c90ca79533121106b38ddeeff7b12d7"
}
]
};

Call the execute method on sn_one_extend.OneExtendUtil.
Optional: To display the response after running the background script, print the response in readable JSON by using the following code:

gs.info(JSON.stringify(sn_one_extend.OneExtendUtil.execute(request))));

# Exploring Now Assist AI agents

Learn how the Now Assist AI agents application can help to improve live agent productivity by using AI agents to perform tasks. AI agents simulate human-like intelligence to handle various tasks that range from automated responses to complex problem solving.

# Now Assist AI agents terminology

- Agentic system: An agentic system is a type of software or AI that perceives its environment, decides that are based on that perception, and takes actions to achieve specific goals, often with minimal human intervention. An agentic system can learn, adapt, and operate independently to solve problems or perform tasks.
- AI agent: On the ServiceNow AI Platform agentic system, an AI agent contains a set of large language model (LLM) instructions with the tools to perform these specific tasks.
- Agentic workflow: In the agentic system on your instance, an agentic workflow contains a set of LLM instructions with one or more AI agents that can execute an objective.

# AI agents overview

The Now Assist AI agents application is designed to securely leverage your data, workflows, and integrations natively on the ServiceNow AI Platform. AI agents can dynamically adjust the actions that are based on the progress and changing conditions of incidents or cases to help ensure that they stay focused on achieving their objectives.

Use AI agents to do the following tasks for your organization:

- Dynamically figure out a plan to resolve an incident or case.
- Collaborate with other AI agents for subtasks as needed.
- Take feedback from humans as needed.
- Work on knowledge-intensive tasks that need information, understanding, and skills to accomplish that task.
- Find a solution by using multiple sources of knowledge or similar incidents.
- Plan to solve an issue with human collaboration.
- Avoid iterations and discovery by defining a specific flow.

You can create, duplicate, or modify agentic workflows. You must activate the base system agentic workflows before they can be used. For more information about activating an agentic workflow, see agentic workflow template. For more information about cloning an agentic workflow, see Clone an agentic workflow.

The base system agentic workflows remain read only. You must duplicate them to use them. For more information about cloning an agentic workflow, see Clone an agentic workflow. You can modify the duplicated base system agentic workflow to meet your requirements. For more information, see Modify an agentic workflow. You must activate the base system agentic workflows before they can be used. For more information about activating an agentic workflow, see agentic workflow template.

# AI agents design and run-time flows

Now Assist AI agents have two components: AI agents and agentic workflows. By using Guided Setup in AI Agent Studio, you create AI agents and workflows, add tools or define triggers, and define the availability or display location. After they're created, you can duplicate, modify, and test them in AI Agent Studio.

In run time, triggers in the primary and secondary interfaces cause agentic workflow execution, where one or more AI agents execute the plan with the help of the AI Agent Orchestrator to accomplish the task. After agentic workflow execution, the output appears in the Now Assist panel. To learn more about what an AI Agent Orchestrator is, see the Now Assist AI Agents Orchestrator section in this topic.

# How to put Now Assist AI agents to work

AI agents can use a variety of tools, such as web searches, record operations, and flows, to work on agentic workflows that you define.

Navigate to All > AI Agent Studio > Overview > Get an overview of what to expect and select View steps to see how you can successfully put your AI agents to work.

1. Create an agentic workflow: agentic workflows define the problem and situation that you want your AI agents to work on. Without an agentic workflow, your agents don’t know when or what to work on.
2. Create AI agents: AI agents use tools to execute tasks. Consider the tasks needed to solve the agentic workflow you created. Create one or more agents to execute those tasks.
3. Test the agentic workflow: See how your AI agents perform. Make adjustments to either the agentic workflow or AI agents. Test until everything’s working the way you want.
4. Deploy: Put your AI agents to work across your organization.

# Now Assist AI agents Orchestrator

You can use the AI Agent Orchestrator to verify that your AI agent teams work together and track agentic workflows across the enterprise.

The AI Agent Orchestrator in the agentic framework is a coordinator entity that handles collaboration across multiple agents by routing requests from one agent to other agents to help accomplish a complex task. The AI Agent Orchestrator can also reach out to one of the agents involved in the task accomplishment to get the missing context or information from the user for task completion.

AI agents don’t work in isolation. If they get stuck or fail completing a task, they can go back to the AI Agent Orchestrator and ask for help, using the iterative aspect of the AI agents.

# Citations in Now Assist AI agents

When you execute AI agents and agentic workflows in Now Assist AI agents, you can see citations on the Now Assist panel by default that provide summaries to get similar incidents and relevant knowledge articles.

# Generating citations:

- Citations are generated by the LLM (Large Language Model), which use the information available to it.
- URLs can’t be generated by LLM if relevant information isn’t provided.
- LLMs need to provide proper URLs for better results.
- Citation URLs return directly from the tool’s outputs.
- The LLM is instructed not to generate or assume citations if they aren’t present.

Note: Invalid or malformed URLs won’t be displayed to the user.

Citations with similar incidents and relevant knowledge articles appear in the Sources section of the AI Agent Studio Chat and on the Now Assist panel and in with click-able links that direct you to the incident or knowledge article.

You can hide citations for specific agentic workflows or AI agents where it’s necessary or confidential. For more information, see Disable citations in AI Agent Studio.

# User impersonation in Now Assist AI agents

The agentic workflow executes tools as the logged-in user in the Now Assist panel and in Virtual Agent. Any operations that are performed within the tool in this flow are also executed as the logged-in user. After impersonation is enabled, testing an AI agent uses the instance-level impersonation.

Administrators can see logs with individual AI agent names as a record of who approved the agentic action in an agentic workflow. The logs help when determining a point of contact if there’s an issue with the approved agentic action by the AI agent.

With impersonation, the fulfiller in the Now Assist panel and the requester in Virtual Agent can see the transactions recorded in the name of the AI agent that performed the agentic workflow execution.

For example, you could task the Resolve an incident agentic workflow to resolve a specific incident. After the task begins, you can see the AI agent conversation, the AI Agent Orchestrator, and the chain of logic that is used to achieve the task.

The following example shows the inputs for a resolve requests agentic workflow on the testing page of AI Agent Studio.

# Domain separation and Now Assist AI Agent Studio

Domain separation is supported for Now Assist AI Agent Studio. Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data.

# Domain Separation Overview

Now Assist AI agents use basic domain separation capabilities to help protect your users' data. Domain separation support for AI agents is applied at design time and run time.

# Design-time support

Refers to creating or updating agentic workflows, agents, tools, trigger configurations, and so on. AI agent configurations can be made domain-specific for individual agents and the actual agentic workflows. Administrators can apply specific domains to those records. Similar to other basic domain separation capabilities.

---


# Run-time support

Refers to the agentic conversation on the Now Assist panel, web client, or any conversational channel. In the agentic conversations, the user that the agent impersonates functions as an agent with any AI agents who initiate the conversation on demand. For example, if the conversation is happening via a trigger mentioned on the Run as field on the Trigger form of an agentic workflow. If the user that the agent impersonates belongs to the same or a higher domain, that agent can access and use configurations that are associated with that domain.

The domain visibility for an agentic workflow is resolved during run time based on the Run as attribute in the agentic workflow trigger condition. For more information, see defining a trigger for an agentic workflow.

When an agentic conversation is triggered on demand, the domain visibility is applied to the particular agent in action. When an agentic conversation is initiated through a trigger, the domain visibility is applied to the user who resolves the caller (in an incident record where the Run as attribute is set to Caller), when the conversation runs against the incident record.

Note: The sys_domain field is added to all AI agent tables to achieve domain separation in Now Assist AI agents. The sys_domain_path, which is available for domain separation, is enabled on your instance.

To understand more about the ServiceNow domain separation, see Exploring domain separation.

# How domain separation works in Now Assist AI Agent Studio

Process separation is enabled through the use of the sys_overrides column in domain-aware tables. Any table that contains both the sys_domain and the sys_overrides fields can be configured to have different processes from the parent domain.

AI Agents support only configuration tables to be process separated. Below are the list of tables that are process separated:

- sn_aia_agent_config
- sn_aia_usecase_config_override

Domain separation in Now Assist AI agents supports:

- Agentic workflow discovery.
- AI agent and its tools can be active in the X domain and inactive in the Y domain.
- Memory category can be active in the X domain and inactive in the Y domain.
- sn_aia_property can be overridden in a different domain.
- Triggers can be overridden in different domain.

Note: AI agent and agentic workflow details can’t be overridden in the different domains.

# Multiple conversations in Now Assist AI agents

Multiple active conversations enable live agents to maintain separate conversations for different records. You can preserve the context of multiple conversations and enable multiple AI agents to interact at the same time through the Now Assist panel.

# Multiple conversations between live agents and AI agents overview

Once configured, live agents can interact with multiple AI agent conversations through the Now Assist panel.

Note: By default, the Now Assist panel currently supports only a single conversation and it is required for you to enable the multiple conversation support if you intend to use it.

# Enabling multiple conversations

Enable multiple conversations on a ServiceNow instance in the Messaging Channels [sys_cs_channel.list] table by setting the value of the Supports Multiple Conversations field on the Now Assist panel record to true. If you don’t see this field, make sure you are in the Global scope and are using the Default view. By saving the record and refreshing the instance, you can see the multiple active conversations features in the Now Assist panel.

# Title for the conversation

With the multiple conversations feature enabled in the Now Assist panel, the first utterance from the live agent is set as the title for that conversation. For example, if the first utterance is Explain change risk, then Explain change risk is set as the title for that conversation in the Now Assist panel.

# Starting a new conversation

Start a new conversation by selecting the plus icon ( ) and choosing a topic. See the conversation list by selecting the All chats icon ( ), to see the Active chats and Closed chats.

# Unread chats on the conversation list

See the batch count of the unread chats on the conversation list icon ( ). For example, if number 6 appears on the All chats icon ( ), that means there's six unread conversations on the Now Assist panel.

# General guidelines for creating AI agents and agentic workflows

By following some general guidelines for creating AI agents and agentic workflows, you can create clear and effective instructions that help maximize their efficiency and effectiveness.

Creating AI agents and agentic workflows overview

# Follow these guidelines when writing AI instructions for an AI agent or agentic workflow.

# Clarity

- Use instructions that are concise, clear, and precise. Simple language can help remove ambiguous situations that could stall or disrupt an agent's progress. Example: "You’re an assistant tasked with helping the caller or requester by suggesting answers to survey questions." instead of "You help callers with questions."
- Use specific action verbs. Example: "Analyze" instead of "look at."
- Add explicit conditions when a certain step must be completed. Example: "If priority = High, then escalate immediately" instead of "escalate urgent issues."
- Clarify boundaries and limitations. Example: "NEVER modify incident status without supervisor approval."
- Limit technical jargon. Technical jargon can limit applicability because it may not be accessible or universal.

# Context

# Guidelines for creating AI agents

# Embed requirements within context

- Specify when certain requirements should be used within the task. Example: "When generating answers to present to the user, apply standard quality controls."
- Only include the context that affects decision making. Avoid extraneous information to help prevent the AI agent or agentic workflow from incorporating unwanted details.
- Define what good outcomes look like. Include examples. Missing or vague descriptions of results could result in AI agents or agentic workflows exiting before the end state is achieved. Example: "Present the user with a report that includes a minimum of 3 relevant graphs pertaining to the list of records."

# Constraints

- Denote hard requirements. Use strong language to insist on the importance of the requirements. While output cannot be guaranteed to follow these requirements, being specific about standards can help reduce deviations.
- Describe preferences that can be adjusted based on context.
- Add conditional restraints. Example: "If more than one record is returned, present the results to the user in order of creation date. If more than five records are returned, present the results to the user in order of relevance."

# Coherence

- Create steps that flow logically. Each step should build on the results of the previous step. Example: "Step 1 gathers a list of incident records. Step 2 performs record operations on those list of records."
- Use consistent terminology throughout.
- Design instructions that serve the overall objective. All of your tools and AI agents work together to solve problems.
- Break complex goals into individual pieces. Example: "Step 1: Analyze customer data systematically. Step 2: Check priority and validation permissions. Step 3: Generate and format comprehensive report."

# Structure

- Use consistent formatting. Similar instructions should use similar language patterns.
- Group related steps together.
- Create a smooth flow from instruction to instruction. Along with grouped instructions and logical step progression, this provides a systematic and structured process for the AI agent or agentic workflow to follow.

# The description, AI agent role, and list of steps

are the sections that give the LLM the context and instructions to perform a task. Together, they form the blueprint that's necessary for the LLM to complete its role in a complex workflow. Follow these guidelines to improve the accuracy, adaptability, and optimization of the AI agent:

---



# AI agent role

- Clearly state the primary function of the AI agent in one or two sentences. Example: "The AI agent acts as a customer service assistant."
- State the specific business challenge that you want the AI agent to address. Example: "Reducing customer wait times by 50%."
- Provide a brief scenario of how the AI agent is to be used. Example: "Automating responses to common queries and escalating complex issues to human agents."

# AI agent list of steps

- Create a logical progression from step to step.
- Use action-oriented language. Use verbs like the following:
- Fetch
- Retrieve
- Filter
- Analyze
- Extract
- Parse
- Update
- Send
- Notify
- Generate
- Validate
- Include outputs for each step to measure the task completion. Example: "Return the total incident count to other agents or processes that need it."
- Add contingencies to account for unexpected scenarios. Example: "If you encounter an error while looking up records, try again. If you still get an error, report that an error occurred."
- Define success and completion. Provide end states so that the AI Agent Orchestrator can determine whether an AI agent has finished its objective.
- If you've created a tool for your AI agent, refer to the tool by name. However, you should make sure that the instructions change if the tool is ever renamed. If you don't, then the AI agent could be unable to complete its task.

# AI Agent Tool Description

- Write detailed tool descriptions to help the AI agent learn what the tool is and how best to use it.
- Create tools that work together. Build your tools around achieving the list of steps for the AI agent itself.
- Use the output transformation strategy field to define what the output of a tool should look like. Specifying how a tool should present its output can help the AI agent use that output when employing other tools or when sharing information between other agents.

# Example AI Agent

# Name

Categorize ITSM incident AI agent

# Description

Categorize ITSM incident AI agent assigns the appropriate category, subcategory, and configuration item (CI) to an incident.

# AI Agent Role

You're an expert in analyzing incidents and are tasked with assigning an appropriate category, subcategory, and configuration item (CI).

# List of Steps

Objective: Incidents represent disruptions, unavailability of a service, or issues faced by a user. The agent's task is to understand the issue and assign the appropriate:

- Category
- Subcategory
- Configuration Item (CI)

# Step 1: Retrieve Incident Details.

- Fetch the details of the given incident.
- DO NOT PROCEED if incident details are missing.
- If no details are found, verify the correctness of the incident number.
- Only proceed when incident details are successfully retrieved.

# Step 2: Assign Category, Subcategory, and CI.

# Step 2.1: Determine the Category.

- Fetch the available categories.
- Recommend a category only if the incident details contain clear, specific, and meaningful information that directly corresponds to one of the available categories.
- If the details are too vague, generic, lack context, or do not clearly indicate a relevant category, then set the category and subcategory to "Not determined" (field_value = null). Do not edit the subcategory later.

---


# Incident Categorization Process

• Do not infer or guess a category based on common or placeholder terms (for example, "test", "check", "issue") unless they are accompanied by enough context to confidently justify a match.

• You must be 100% certain that the incident clearly belongs to a category before assigning it.

# Step 2.2: Determine the Subcategory.

• Fetch the list of available subcategories for the chosen category.

• Choose the most appropriate subcategory based on the incident details.

• If no suitable subcategory can be determined or if the category is not determined, set subcategory to: "Not determined" (field_value = null).

# Step 2.3: Determine the Configuration Item (CI).

• Fetch the list of CIs assigned to the caller of the incident.

• Pick the most relevant CI based on:

- Name
- Manufacturer
- Asset Name

• If no relevant CI is found or the list is empty, set CI to: "Not determined" (field_value = null).

• If multiple options exist, select the most relevant one.

# Step 3: Present the Recommendation.

• PRESENT the recommended values to the user in the following bullet-point format:

Recommended incident ({incident number}) categorization details:

- Category: {recommended category}, (Reason: {reason for recommendation})
- Subcategory: {recommended subcategory}, (Reason: {reason for recommendation})
- Caller's CI: {recommended CI}, (Reason: {reason for recommendation})

• Ensure this information is explicitly displayed before proceeding to the next step.

# Step 4: Update the Incident.

Update the incident record with the selected Category, Subcategory, and CI values.

# Key Considerations:

- • NEVER ask the user for input.
- • Never proceed without retrieving incident details.
- • If NO appropriate value is found, assign "Not determined" (field_value = null).
- • Do NOT ask the user to manually determine category, subcategory, or CI.

# Guidelines for Creating Agentic Workflows

• Always present recommendations before updating the incident.

• Ensure that the recommendations are logical and relevant to the incident details.

# Agentic Workflow List of Steps

- Write each step sequentially and number each step so that there’s a logical and actionable flow.
- Account for as many possibilities as you can to avoid gaps. Provide enough detail that the agentic workflow can adapt if it encounters an edge case.
- Define the starting conditions, actions, decision points, and end states.
- Refer to end users as "the user."
- Use verbs like "show," "display," or "inform" to describe steps where the user needs to be shown something but they do not need to provide input.

# Additional Tips

Associate a maximum of 10 agents per agentic workflow. Adding more agents doesn’t necessarily mean that you get better or faster results. Instead, use small, well-defined scopes.

Note: You can assign up to 100 agents to an agentic workflow. However, not all 100 agents may be involved in resolving the agentic workflow because the AI Agent Orchestrator decides which agents should execute the plan. For example, an incident resolution gets impacted by the size of the agentic workflow and the number of agents that are assigned to it.

When creating agentic workflows with more than one assigned agent, make sure that you clearly define the agents with non-overlapping responsibilities. Include explicit limitations in the agents' roles. For example, one agent could handle user record details while another agent handles the incident record details.

# Example Agentic Workflow

# Name

Investigate incident

# Description

This workflow streamlines incident management by analyzing incidents, linking them to existing problems, and identifying relevant catalog items. It leverages three specialized AI agents: the ITSM Incident Resolution Investigation AI Agent retrieves incident details, identifies similar incidents, and fetches relevant knowledge articles; the Link Incident to Problem AI Agent searches for and links incidents to existing problems based on contextual similarity; and the Find Catalog Item AI Agent locates relevant catalog items and integrates their details into incident records or provides direct links. This structured orchestration ensures efficient incident resolution, reduces redundancy, and enhances decision-making by leveraging historical data, organizational knowledge, and catalog resources, ultimately improving enterprise incident management effectiveness.

# List of steps

# Step 1: Incident Analysis:

Analyze incident details and retrieve relevant historical data and knowledge articles.

# Step 1.1: Retrieve Incident Context:

- Use the ITSM Incident Resolution Investigation AI Agent to fetch incident details (short description, description, caller, state).
- If retrieval fails, inform the user: "Unable to retrieve incident details. Please verify the incident number." and terminate workflow.

# Step 1.2: Identify Similar Incidents and Knowledge Articles:

- Use the ITSM Incident Resolution Investigation AI Agent to find similar incidents and relevant knowledge articles.
- Confirm with the user before adding resolutions to incident comments.

# Step 1.3: Prepare Incident Documentation:

Update incident additional comments with approved resolutions and knowledge article references, preparing clear documentation for next phase.

# Step 2: Problem Linking:

Link the incident to an existing relevant problem, if applicable.

# Step 2.1: Receive Incident Documentation:

Use Link Incident to Problem AI Agent to validate incident details and confirm no existing problem linkage.

# Step 2.2: Identify Relevant Problems:

- Execute search for relevant problems using incident short description.
- If no relevant problems found, inform the user: "No relevant problems found to link." and proceed to Catalog Item Identification.

# Step 2.3: Link Incident to Problem:

- Present most similar problem details to the user for approval.
- Upon user approval, link incident to problem using "Set problem to incident" tool; confirm successful linkage to the user.

# Step 3: Catalog Item Identification:

Identify and integrate relevant catalog items into the incident record.

# Step 3.1: Receive Incident and Problem Context:

Use Find Catalog Item AI Agent to validate incident context and prepare for catalog item search.

# Step 3.2: Execute Catalog Item Search:

---



• Perform targeted search for relevant catalog items based on incident description.

• If no catalog items found, inform the user: "No relevant catalog items identified." and proceed to final delivery.

# Step 3.3: Integrate Catalog Item Details:

• Present catalog item choices to the user; upon selection, either add catalog item details to incident additional comments or provide direct catalog item link.

• Confirm successful integration or delivery to the user and complete workflow.

# Common issues

# Problem: Agent consistently uses the wrong tool

# Potential solutions:

- Create clear, specific instructions with action keywords.
- Write detailed tool descriptions that specify when and why to use each tool.
- Include explicit input and output guidance in tool descriptions.
- Evaluate tool selection logic by testing against various scenarios.

# Problem: Inconsistent output quality

# Potential solutions:

- Embed standards as actionable requirements.
- Use phrases such as "implementing professional standards."
- Add quality verification steps.

# Problem: Quality checks or other steps skipped

# Potential solutions:

- Convert checklists to actionable steps.
- Use phrases such as "analyze completion against criteria."
- Add conditional progression logic.

# Group Action Framework

Group Action Framework (GAF) is an intelligence feature on the ServiceNow AI Platform that groups related records and applies actions to them using LLMs.

# GAF overview

GAF is composed of two processes. The grouping process identifies clusters of similar records (incident, cases, KB articles, etc.) and selects a set of representative records for the cluster. The actioning process maps new records to clusters and executes large language model (LLM) instructions for those clusters to achieve certain tasks, such as summarizing the contents of a cluster or generating resolution steps based on steps that worked for records in that cluster. GAF processes together benefit your AI agents and Now Assist generative features in multiple ways.

---


# GAF Overview

• Improves consistency and quality of agentic and generative AI features by using the best examples from groups of records.

• Reduces the cost of LLM calls by only executing on the representative records.

• Scales to accommodate large amounts of data because selected records can represent any size cluster.

# Skills used in GAF

Multiple skills are involved in GAF setup and execution. They are modular, so not all executions will use all skills, but they can be used together in tandem. These skills are used exclusively for GAF and currently cannot be included on their own in custom agentic workflows.

# Grouping skill

Clusters related records using machine learning techniques.

# Topic-labeling skill

Adds human-readable names to the clusters using an LLM to make the clusters easier to identify.

# Action strategy skill

Selects representative records from each cluster for the mapper and reducer skills to use.

# Action mapper skill

Runs LLM inference calls for the selected representative records, producing a record summary for the selected records.

# Action reducer skill

Uses the generated summaries created by the mapper skill to produce a single summary for the entire cluster.

# GAF and Now Assist in AI Search

GAF uses AI Search to improve its effectiveness and can use it as a fallback option in case GAF does not return any results. GAF can work without Now Assist in AI Search, but if it is enabled then GAF has optimized prediction. The optimized prediction feature increases clustering capacity up to 500,000 records and improves recall speed.

See Install Now Assist in AI Search and Set up AI Search for Group Action Framework for more information on configuring AI Search for GAF.

# Version control for AI agents and agentic workflows

Version control enables you to track changes made to instructions sent to the LLM for AI agents and agentic workflows.

# Version control overview

When creating an AI agent or agentic workflow, the List of steps field is important because it provides the context necessary for the large language model (LLM) to accomplish tasks. You can use version control to create multiple versions of the List of steps field in the guided setup. Tracking your changes with version control helps enable you to experiment and test new instructions. You can create versions, edit and refine versions, and revert to previous versions as needed.

Doing so brings up the Create a new version modal where you can name the version and make changes. Naming your version enables you to identify what changes were made to make it easier to track.

You can choose to make the new version active immediately by selecting the Set as active toggle.

For more information about writing effective descriptions and instructions, see General guidelines for creating AI agents and agentic workflows.

When creating a new version, you also have the option to use Now Assist to refine your current List of steps. You must already have an active version for this option to be available. Selecting View versions > Refine version brings up the modal where Now Assist generates and displays a new List of steps for you to review. You can change any of the generated text, or you can use it as it was generated. Select Create to use the new, refined version.

# Configuring AI agents

# Prerequisites

By making a plan, you can improve your AI agent performance and result quality. When you have a solid foundation of what you want to build, you can minimize creating redundant agents and maximizing the efficiency of your existing ones. Before you send instructions to your AI agents, make sure that you follow these prerequisites:

- Have a good idea of the different kinds of tasks that your agentic workflow should be able to handle.
- Understand the general flow for your agentic workflow and agents.
- Use agentic tools with well-written descriptions.

# Configurable elements

Instruct the agentic workflows and AI agents through the following elements within the framework:

- Base plan: Instructions to the AI Agent Orchestrator for the initial planning procedure that is configured at the agentic workflow level.
- Role: Clear identity of the AI agent that includes these elements:
- Agent reasoning: When a role is added to each reasoning prompt, it provides a sense of identity to the content that is generated by the LLM.
- Agent proficiency: An LLM-generated description of what an agent is capable of, including the content from the role, instructions, and the descriptions from the tools that are assigned to the AI agent.

Note: The agent proficiency is auto-generated.
- Instructions: Clear directives for the AI agent. Write instructions as a step-by-step algorithm that describes the operational flow for the AI agent.

# Configuring the tools for agentic workflows

Define the procedure to build functional tools for your agentic workflow with the following three elements:

# Functionality

What an AI agent contributes to the agentic workflow. Configure the tools with a single purpose. Multipurpose tools can cause a problem for the agents for the following reasons:

- Multipurpose tools are harder for the AI agent to reason through and determine when to use the tool. If a tool can be used for more than one purpose, the AI Agent Orchestrator has to determine which purpose is most.

# Tool description

Natural language descriptions that describe the utility provided by the tool. Make sure that you define the scope and limits of the tools clearly to help ensure that the tools are picked for the appropriate scenarios in the following ways:

- Provide a description of what the tool is supposed to do.
- Describe the scenarios where the tool can be called. Include the specific agentic workflows and tasks where the tool and its functionality can be used.
- Explore the scenarios where the tool is explicitly not useful but an AI agent can confuse the tool as being useful.
- Explain the terms that are being used in the preceding cases. For example, if you have a tool for assigning a role to a user, you must explain what the role is in the agentic system of the given instance.

# Error messages

An AI agent operates through trial and error. For example, an error message about an execution that accidentally ran incorrect tools can help the AI agent reach more valid conclusions in the future. Error messages offer an AI agent a chance to reflect and explore other options.

Understanding the scenarios where the tool can go wrong can help the AI agent with keeping the execution on track.

# Install Now Assist AI agents

Install Now Assist AI agents on your ServiceNow instance to enable the agentic AI experience.

# Configure Group Action Framework

Set up Group Action Framework (GAF) to improve the response quality, recall speed, and consistency of AI agents.

# Before you begin

There must be a ml_platform read ACL for GAF to be configured. If there is no read ACL present, you must create it and grant the appropriate role access, such as admin, ml_admin, or sn_aia.admin. This is required for GAF to access Machine Learning tables and services. If your ACL is not configured correctly, you may see the error "Failed to initialize pipeline: Failed to load message_content dataset. No columns to parse from file."

To access GAF's optimized prediction feature, you can enable Now Assist in AI Search. For more information, see Setup AI Search for Group Action Framework.

Role required: sn_aia.admin

# About this task

You can activate GAF to have AI agents use indexed clusters that perform LLM executions on representative records rather than all records. GAF is used by some AI agents and agentic workflows to work optimally. For more information about GAF and how it works, see Group Action Framework.

You can have different GAF configurations for different agentic workflows and Now Assist applications. You must configure each agentic workflow or application separately.

Important: Setting up GAF can take some time, between 10 minutes up to an hour, depending on the number of records in the grouping. The script runs in the background.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > System Definition > Scripts - Background.
2. Paste the following code into the text area.

Do not run the script until the groupSkillID and the actionSkillID variables have values. The values are acquired in the following steps.
var groupSkillId = "";
var actionSkillId = "";
var topicSkillId = "43bce9e477e012103f075cea5b5a998f";
new sn_gaf.GAFUtils().activate(groupSkillId, topicSkillId, actionSkillId, "run_once");

The topicSkillId is the same for all GAF setups.

In a new browser tab, navigate to the Now Assist Skill Config [sn_nowassist_skill_config] table by entering sn_nowassist_skill_config.list in the filter navigator.
In the Name field, enter *grouping and search to see the grouping records that are associated with your agentic workflows and Now Assist applications.

---


# 5.

Open the grouping record for the agentic workflow or application that you want to configure.

# 6.

In the Now Assist Config Var Set related list, open the Grouping inputs record.

# 7.

Confirm that the filters for the grouping include all the records you want to index.

If you want to add filters to change what records are included in the GAF setup, do so here. The more records that you include means that you have a longer setup time, but they can help increase the quality of your results. You should have at least 2000 records for successful clustering.

Note: Your current scope should be Group-Action Framework to make changes.

# 8.

Return to the Now Assist Skill Config Grouping record and copy the sys_id. You use this sys_id and two other sys_ids in the background script function call.

# 9.

In the browser tab with the background script, paste the sys_id in the script between the quotation marks for the groupSkillId variable.

Your groupSkillId variable should be in the same format as the topicSkillId variable.

# 10.

In the tab with the Now Assist Skill Config record, return to the Now Assist Skill Config table and search for action strategy to find the action strategy skill config for the application. Make sure that the record is for the same application. If you pasted the sys_id of the GAF ITSM grouping, you must open the GAF ITSM action strategy.

# 11.

Open the action strategy record for the application that you’re configuring.

# 12.

Copy the sys_id of the action strategy record.

# 13.

In the browser tab with the background script, paste the sys_id in the script between the quotation marks for the actionSkillId variable.

---


Your actionSkillId variable should be in the same format as the groupSkillId and topickillId variables.

# 14. Run the background script by selecting Run script.

Running this background script creates a scheduled job called GAF - Run Offline Flow. You can view the scheduled job on the Scheduled Script Executions [sysauto_script] table. If you want to run the script immediately, open the Scheduled Script Execution record and select Execute Now.

The script runs in the background.

# Result

GAF is configured on your instance for that Now Assist application and can be used by AI agents to find related records.

# What to do next

To verify that grouping and action outputs have been generated, go to the ML Solution [ml_solution] table to check if the clustering solution is running or completed. If it is complete, check the following tables to see records for groups, clustered records, and down-sampled records per group are present.

- GAF record group [sn_gaf_record_group]
- GAF record group detail [sn_gaf_record_group_detail]
- GAF action strategy result [sn_gaf_action_strategy_result]

You can repeat this procedure for additional agentic workflows and Now Assist applications.

You may see the error "Failed to initialize pipeline: Failed to load message_content dataset. No columns to parse from file." when trying to configure GAF. This could be because your instance lacks data on the table or filters you configured excluded records from the table. You can reach out to Now Support for additional assistance if you cannot resolve this error.

# Modify an AI agent

Modify an AI agent in AI Agent Studio to suit your changing business needs.

# Before you begin

Role required: sns_aia.admin

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > AI Agent Studio > Create and manage > AI agents
2. Select the AI agent that you want to modify.
3. Modify the different sections of the Guided Setup, making changes to the fields for your requirements.

For the List of steps field, you can create multiple versions of the same AI agent without losing previous versions. Creating versions enables you to test different instructions to evaluate performance. See Version control for AI agents and agentic workflows for more information.

You can navigate through the steps of Guided Setup with the Continue and Back buttons.

Note: Some fields aren't editable if the agent is associated with a Now Assist application.

Navigate to the last step and select Test to save your changes and begin testing your modified agent.

# Result

Your agent is modified and ready to test.

# Add a tool to an AI agent

Add a tool to an AI agent to enable different functionalities and help your AI agents achieve their objectives.

# Tool overview

Tools provide your AI agents with the capabilities necessary to complete their tasks. When adding tools, consider how the AI agent will use them to achieve its objectives as well as how those tools interact with each other. Providing your AI agents with the appropriate tools help ensure the robustness and quality of their performance.

Some additional guidelines for adding and creating tools are the following:

- Design tools to work together. Your AI agent should solve a specific, discrete task, and the tools should give the AI agent all of the capabilities necessary to achieve its goal.
- Write detailed tool descriptions. Tool descriptions are used by the AI agent to determine a tool's function. Thorough descriptions about what the tools are and how they work will give the AI agent the best chance to succeed.
- Consider the outputs of tools when creating them. Use the tool description or output transformation strategy fields to describe how to process the tool outputs. For example, if you have a tool that gathers records from a large number of tables, provide the tool with plans for how to handle the amount of records that the query could return.

# Agentic evaluation run results

Learn about agentic evaluation runs and the meaning behind different evaluation scores from the agentic evaluation results page.

# Agentic evaluations overview

Agentic evaluations measure how well agentic workflows are accomplishing their objectives. A Now LLM Service model judges the agentic workflow based on the execution logs of that agentic workflow. The results page of an evaluation run shows multiple metrics and scores measuring task completeness and tool use.

If you run an overall task completion evaluation, the results page shows recommended actions for the workflow. Recommended actions give you suggestions for deployment or improvement to help ensure that the agentic workflows that you deploy are performing up to your standards.

For more information on AI agent usage and other analytics, you can review the AI Agent Analytics dashboard in the AI Agent Studio.

# Evaluation results overview

For each evaluation method that you execute, the results page displays an overall score for the agentic workflow with a percentage of successful record evaluations and a label of

# Individual record metric scores

Evaluations are run against the log tables of agentic workflow executions. Each record is individually scored for each evaluation plan that you run. Individual record evaluations are scored according to the following metrics.

# Overall task completeness record metric scores

The overall task completeness metric assesses whether an AI agent successfully completes its assigned task. It evaluates the execution logs of the agent, ensuring that all required steps were taken and the task was logically and effectively completed.

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Number Score</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Successful - The main task was fully completed. All subtasks were resolved, and the steps followed a logical sequence with no critical errors.</td>

<td>Partially successful - The task was partially completed. Some subtasks remain unresolved or inefficiencies affected the process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Unsuccessful - The task wasn’t completed. Critical subtasks were abandoned or unresolved or the execution failed entirely.</td>

# Now Assist glossary

Learn about the terms and concepts used in Now Assist AI agents.

# Agentic system

An agentic system is a type of software or AI that perceives its environment, makes decisions that are based on that perception, and takes actions to achieve specific goals, often with minimal human intervention. An agentic system can learn, adapt, and operate independently to solve problems or perform tasks.

# Agentic workflow

In the agentic system on your instance, an agentic workflow contains a set of LLM instructions with one or more AI agents that can execute an objective.

# AI agent

An AI agent contains a set of large language model (LLM) instructions with the tools to perform these specific tasks.

# Citation

Small, interactable number next to AI-generated content in the Now Assist panel that cites the source of the information.

# Configuring Now Assist Skill Kit

# Using Now Assist Skill Kit

# General guidelines for Now Assist Skill Kit

General guidelines are available to use Now Assist Skill Kit.

# Now Assist Skill Kit guidelines overview

Think about the process of building a custom skill as having the following phases:

1. Scoping the skill
2. Collecting data and creating a dataset
3. Developing the prompt
4. Conducting a performance evaluation
5. Deploying and monitoring the skill

# The stages of building a custom skill

You should adopt a data-driven mindset while you build a skill. A data-driven mindset means emphasizing evidence-based decisions and minimizing speculation about how a large language model (LLM) can interpret the specific wording of a prompt.

Now Assist Skill Kit needs intermediate skills in prompt engineering. If you're not a developer, you should equip yourself with the relevant knowledge before working with this tool.

There’s information and helpful tooltips in many places throughout the product. Use this information to understand how to use the tool more effectively.

To ensure that there’s a proper segregation of duties, a developer or generative AI practitioner creates the skill and then publishes it. After the skill is published, a Now Assist Admin will activate the skill, so that it shows up at the configured touch points and is available to use.

# Scoping the skill

Scoping the skill before you build it helps determine the requirements needed for the skill and the expected outcomes.

# Before you begin

Before you start to build a custom skill with Now Assist Skill Kit, you should first review the base system skills that are available in the Now Assist Admin console. Use these pre-existing skills whenever possible.

# User prerequisites

Now Assist Skill Kit is meant to be used by a developer or someone with experience using generative AI. Because you must write the initial prompt template, you should:

1. Be knowledgeable about prompt engineering, including:
- Having familiarity with the development and testing of machine learning systems.
- Having informed expectations about the behavior and capabilities of a prompted large language model (LLM). You should understand:
- The fundamentally probabilistic nature of LLMs.
- That performance can vary greatly across different LLMs and different target tasks.
- Having experience or training with writing and evaluating prompts for LLMs.
2. Have an in-depth understanding of the use case that they’re trying to solve and the persona that they’re building the skill for.

# Design

Before you begin building a custom skill, you must think about the overall design and document the requirements. Consider the following:

1. What precisely do you want the skill to do?
- What will be the inputs to the model?
- What should be the outputs of the model? (Both content and format)
- Who will be using the skill?
- How can you characterize success?
2. What don't you want the model to do?
- It’s useful to think about the possible risks and downsides of using generative AI outputs so that you can try to guard against them during development and testing.
- It’s worth listing any specific model behaviors (LLM outputs) that would be detrimental or harmful in your specific use case.

# Creating a dataset using Now Assist Skill Kit

Use these guidelines to create an effective dataset. Having an effective dataset provides better results for your prompt.

# Now Assist Skill Kit dataset creation overview

A data-driven approach to skill development relies on the collection of a high-quality dataset to develop and test the skill. When you use Now Assist Skill Kit, you can also leverage the existing capabilities of the ServiceNow AI Platform to create a high-quality dataset.

When collecting data for this purpose, you should aim to create datasets that are:

# 1. Representative of the skill’s intended deployment environment.

The data should:

- Seek to reflect the expected distribution of inputs in the deployment environment.
- Capture variance along several identified axes, for example, input length, urgency.
- Include any examples of inputs that are known to be important to the use case.
- Consider edge cases (which may be rare) but that are suspected to cause problems, for example, long examples.

# 2. Sized appropriately for the team’s risk appetite.

It’s possible to develop and deploy a skill with little data. However, a lack of data creates more uncertainty about how the skill performs in deployment.

You should think like statisticians and produce confidence intervals for any associated performance scores and prompt comparisons.

# 3. Isolated from the data used for developing and writing the prompts.

You should split the data collected into development and testing sets. By splitting the data, you are protecting some data solely for evaluation purposes.

If you use all the data during the process of developing the prompt, your final evaluation of the skill is biased, meaning that it over-reports performance. This bias is because of a phenomenon known as prompt overfitting.

# Developing the prompt

Use the guidelines to help create a prompt for your skill. A specific, clear, contextual prompt provides better results.

# Prompt development overview

As a prompt engineer, you should make development decisions by looking at the model outputs that are generated in response to a prompt applied to many different inputs. However, there are still certain guidelines that may help users get started with prompt design.

# 1. Be specific

Define your desired outcome clearly. Be specific about the task that you want the model to fulfill. Clearly identify the inputs that you're providing to the model, and specify the output you’re expecting from the model (including formatting).

# 2. Include the right context

Provide background information and context relevant for fulfilling the task. This information can generate a more focused response.

# 3. Use clear language

Use precise and unambiguous language while writing the prompt.

# 4. Include demonstrations

If possible, experiment with providing completed examples, or demonstrations, in the prompt after the instructions to illustrate what you want the model to produce. Demonstrations are a powerful way to increase the likelihood of generating a desirable output. However, the performance changes depending on the demonstrations selected.

---

# 5. Start simple and test variations

Break down complex tasks into smaller and clearer instructions. Have a controlled and iterative approach. Experiment with different structures.

# Other considerations

- Subtle differences in wording can lead to substantial differences in performance. Trying to reason about how a large language model (LLM) may “interpret” the instructions in a prompt only gets you so far. Which specific choice of prompt-wording works best depends on the underlying model and should ideally be chosen based on evidence (that is, looking at lots of outputs).
- In data-constrained settings, you should iteratively develop several candidate prompts using the development data, then measure the performance of each candidate prompt on the test set, choosing the best one.

# Evaluating the prompt

Evaluating the prompt is an ongoing process that occurs during and after prompt development and completion.

# Prompt evaluation overview

To determine the effectiveness of your prompt, you should evaluate batches of test data. You should copy the model-generated responses and perform evaluations outside of Now Assist Skill Kit.

# During prompt development

Ongoing, improvised evaluation should take place alongside the development of the prompt. This ongoing evaluation enables you to adapt the prompt based on observed model outputs. It may be tempting to test a change to a prompt against just one or two examples, however, to avoid reacting to noise, you should look at larger batches, and consider the statistical significance of the performance differences that you observed.

# Final performance evaluation

Before you deploy a skill, you should test the prompt on a representative batch of data that was isolated from the development process, that is, “test” data. You want to use isolated test data because of a phenomenon known as prompt overfitting. Iteratively editing a prompt based on the model outputs generated on the same data that is used for testing can lead to significant over-estimates of performance. This result is because the prompt can become overspecialized to the specific examples used in development. Even though the effect is typically less dramatic than what occurs when fitting machine learn model parameters to a test dataset, it’s rooted in the same underlying principles, and should be avoided.

# Evaluation metrics

Selecting the right metrics for evaluation is an important consideration. The following list provides a few approaches, each of which may be more or less appropriate depending on the use case.

- Classification-based assessment of short generations
This approach requires labeled records, and it works best when the labels are short, well-defined “right answers,” for example, true or false, multiple-choice, or category selection. In these cases, the model outputs can usually be parsed and formatted, then metrics like precision, recall, F1 scores, and so on can be directly calculated.
- Assessment of longer generations
Many of the most interesting generative AI use cases require longer model generations, and there are many possible “right answers.” In these cases, the output can be scored (by human evaluators) along several different axes, for example:

- Faithfulness
Is the generated text faithful to the context provided in the skill prompt? (The opposite of faithfulness is hallucination, which is to say that the model injects out-of-context information.)
- Correctness
Is the generated text correct relative to the skill instruction?
- Helpfulness
Is the generated text helpful relative to the task that the skill wants to accomplish? (Helpfulness is subjective but it’s important to try to measure. Doing so properly requires a solid understanding of the needs of the people who will ultimately be using the skill.)
- Fluency
Is the generated text grammatically correct? Does it have any typos, issues with coherency, and so on?

Note: It’s useful to score these properties on a scale, like 1-5, rather than with yes or no.

# Deploying and monitoring the skill

After you evaluate the prompt, you can deploy the custom skill and monitor its effectiveness.

# Web search custom skill

The web search custom skill performs an internet search to answer a query when the LLM and AI Search are unable to provide results or whenever web search mode is activated.

The web search custom skill is based on a prebuilt topic block in Virtual Agent Designer, and is available when you activate Now Assist in Virtual Agent. This feature is automatically triggered when both AI Search and the LLM can't find information to answer a user's query. This feature can also be manually triggered whenever end users select the Web search results icon ( ) to enter into web search mode. Once Web Search activates, a third-party AI performs the search and returns with an answer.

For more information about the web search mode end-user display and functionality, see .

The web search parameter is available on the System Properties [sys_properties] table, under the property sn_nowassist_va.websearch_fallback_enabled. The values no_response_from_ai_search and no_response_from_llm trigger when they don’t return information for a query.

Web Search AI choices are available in the OneExtend Definition Configs tab AI Search answers entry in the OneExtend Capabilities [sys_one_extend_capability_list] table. Select one of the AI definitions there, such as Azure OpenAI, and set its value to true. Activate a matching AI credential by navigating to ALL > Connections &#x26; credentials > Credentials, and setting the matching API key (such as OpenAzure API key active value to true).

# Example of an AI system

The AI Control Tower application and the AI Risk and Compliance application play a critical role in managing and governing the responsible use of AI systems, especially in high-stakes domains such as banking and finance.

While AI risks extend beyond banking and finance, consider an AI system for credit scoring in loan approval as an example. This system interacts with other models, interfaces, monitoring tools, and decision rules. The AI Control Tower solution along with the AI Risk and Compliance application can help to ensure compliance and responsible usage when the AI system is created, built, and deployed.

For instance, an organization might use AI to generate credit scores for loan approvals and using those scores to make approval decisions. The AI system can be fed a variety of data from the following large language models (LLMs):

- Now LLM: Provides financial information, payment history, and so on.
- Open AI: Provides details such as bankruptcy filings, court judgments, and so on.
- Azure OpenAI: Provides spending and saving patterns.

The figure in the following example illustrates how an AI system is interrelated with datasets, models, and the broader ecosystem.

# AI Models

# AI models

AI models consist of functions and algorithms that are trained and evaluated on data sets to generate predictions or make decisions.

# AI prompts

Any data, including text or images, that is used to guide, instruct, or influence an AI model’s output. This can also refer to an element in a process that requires user input in a field before moving to the output screen.

# AI datasets

A data set usually consists of records and fields organized into rows and columns. These data sets are stored within a database table.

# AI asset life cycle

The AI asset life cycle defines the series of stages that you must follow to manage an AI system, AI model, prompt, or dataset throughout its useful life.

# AI asset life cycle stages

The AI asset life cycle consists of the following stages:

# Onboard

The onboard stage is the introduction of an AI asset into your organization. During this stage, you can define important details about the AI asset, including the asset version and documentation.

# Assess

The Assess stage is the evaluation of an AI asset to determine its effectiveness, its efficiency, its reliability, and its alignment with your organizational goals. This evaluation includes assessments for the performance, business and risk impact, regulatory compliance, and overall value of each AI asset.

# Build and test

The Build and test stage is the development and testing of an AI asset to prepare it for deployment. When you're developing an AI asset, you must create the asset, code any applicable algorithms, and integrate relevant data sources. After you develop the AI asset, you can run tests to verify that it functions correctly, meets your performance standards, and produces accurate results. You can also identify and resolve bugs.

# Deploy

The Deploy stage is the integration of an AI asset into your existing workflows. During this stage, you can also set up monitoring to track the performance of the AI asset. You can choose to deploy each AI asset through either a gradual roll-out, in which the asset can be used only by a specific subset of users within your organization, or a full roll-out, in which the asset can be used by any user within your organization.

Approvals

# Explore the Approvals section on the Configurations page of AI Control Tower.

# AI steward approval required

When the AI steward approval-required control is active, asset deployment is blocked until it receives an approval from the AI steward. This control is inactive by default but can be activated for required approval before deploying an AI asset.

# Automatically trigger playbooks

Enabling automatically trigger playbooks control triggers approval requests for AI assets. When inactive, only the AI steward can initiate requests manually. The recommendation is to have this control activated in the production environment.

# AI model providers

Explore the AI model providers section on the AI Control Tower configurations page to set up data routing and manage third-party Large Language Model (LLM) and Small Language Model (SLM) providers.

AI model providers enable you to choose data routing and configure the third party LLM models by selecting the permitted model providers.

# Data routing and model providers

# Data routing

Data routing is a technology by which Large Language Model (LLM) and Small Language Model (SLM) requests are routed to the most suitable data center. This technology helps to optimize data traffic, which reduces latency and speeds up response times.

The Data routing and Model providers section enables you to route AI model requests and select the Allowed model providers.

# Regional data routing

Regional data routing routes LLM and SLM requests to data centers within your region. For example, if you’re located in the APJC (Asia Pacific, Japan, and China) region, these requests could be routed to the most suitable data center in the APJC region. Regional data routing can sometimes be mandated by governments of specific regions.

# Global data routing

ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries. Other company names, product names, and logos may be trademarks of the respective companies with which they are associated.

---

When you opt for Global data routing, LLM and SLM requests are routed to the most suitable data center globally.

You can configure the third party LLM model providers using the edit option to choose either Regional or Global data routing and select all the Allowed model providers.

# Fallback and Spillover

# Fallback

If you have active AI systems in ServiceNow® that aren’t supported by your enabled model providers, the ‘fallback mechanism’ enables these systems to continue operating with their default providers. However, if you choose not to enable fallback, these AI systems must be deactivated. AI systems deployed on fallback providers comply with the list of approved providers.

Note: The fallback is activated by default and can be modified.

# Spillover

Regional deployments of AI models may experience limited capacity, which could lead to request rate limiting and impact performance. Enabling spillover can help prevent these performance issues. In ServiceNow®, only Azure OpenAI currently makes this switch. To activate Azure Spillover, you must enable the Allow Spillover option.

For more information about configuring third party LLMs through Data routing configuration, see Configure third party LLMs using AI Control Tower.

# Exploring third party LLMs and data routing configuration

Explore the configuration of third party LLMs and SLMs on AI Control Tower with data routing configuration.

# Configuration overview

There are a few scenarios to consider when configuring LLMs, depending on data routing and region.

# APJC region

The Data routing configuration is available for both regional and global routing. All the allowed providers are visible, and you can edit data routing settings.

# Regulated markets

The Data routing configuration isn’t available, and the list of allowed providers is limited. You can view the allowed provider, but only in a read-only format.

# AMS &#x26; EMEA regions

LLMs follow regional data routing configurations, as there’s no global routing option and you can view all the allowed providers.

Activating Fallback allows AI systems supported by your approved providers to stay active by using their default providers.

Manually deactivating Fallback ensures that these AI systems remain inactive.

For more information about Data routing, Fallback, and Spillover, see AI model providers on the configurations view.

For more information on configuration of third party LLMs for APJC region, see Configure third party LLMs using AI Control Tower.

# Using value templates

Use value templates to define, calculate, and track the value delivered by your AI systems and models.

Value templates introduces a unified and structured framework for defining, calculating, and tracking the value delivered by your AI assets. You can define value based on personas and formulas using customizable templates.

# Value templates offer the following benefits.

- Transparency: Provides visibility into how value is determined for an AI asset.
- Customization: Supports various persona-driven and formula-based definitions.

Currently, value templates are supported for skills and agents. A value template is assigned to an asset when a skill or agent is activated and deployed as an asset in the system. The following table lists the default value templates.

# Default value templates

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>AI asset</td>
<td>Default value template</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ServiceNow skill</td>
<td>Daily skill executions x average assists x 50%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ServiceNow AI agent</td>
<td>Daily agent executions x average assists x 50%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AWS AI agent</td>
<td>Number of invocations x 15 mins x 50%</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

# Natural Language Understanding

ServiceNow® Natural Language Understanding (NLU) provides an NLU Workbench and an NLU inference service that you can use to enable the system to learn and respond to human-expressed intent. By entering natural language examples into the system, you help it understand word meanings and contexts so it can infer user or system actions.

# Overview of Natural Language Understanding

# User input flow in the NLU model build process

</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;strong>Utterance&lt;/strong></td>
<td>A natural language example of a user intent. For example, a text string in an incident's short description, a chat entry, or an email subject line. Utterances are used to build and train intents and should therefore not include several or ambiguous meanings or intents.</td>

# Vocabulary

Vocabulary is used to define or overwrite word meanings. For example, you can assign the synonym “Microsoft” to the acronym “MS”.

# NLU Model

A collection of utterance examples and their associated intents and entities that the system uses as a reference to infer intents and entities in a new utterance. The NLU Workbench comes with pre-built NLU models for specific business units, such as an ITSM model. You can also create custom models.

This image illustrates how Natural Language Understanding processes and renders utterance examples into intents and entities in the system.

# NLU processes and renders utterance examples into intents and entities

# NLU Workbench

Use the NLU Workbench to create morphological representations of human language. These models enable you to create intents and entities expressed in natural language utterances. Any ServiceNow application can invoke an NLU model to get an inference of intents and entities in a given utterance.

Using the nlu_admin role, you build your models in the NLU Workbench, where you create, train, test, and publish them iteratively.

# NLU inference service

Natural Language Understanding provides an NLU inference service that helps the system to understand natural language and drive intelligent actions. This service trains and predicts intents and entities for a given user utterance in your model so that its text translates into machine-understandable formats, such as APIs and parameters.

# Overview of how the system uses an NLU inference API to extract intents and entities

Here, the system uses an inference API to train NLU algorithms by using sample record data to identify intents and entities that are strong candidates for accurate prediction.

# NLU model consumption

Other ServiceNow® applications consume NLU model output, such as Virtual Agent.

# Supported languages and features

Available in Tokyo, Utah, and Vancouver

- German
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Norwegian
- Polish
- Portuguese
- Spanish
- Swedish

With intent and entity support, NLU can understand sophisticated utterances such as intent-entity relationships, system entities, and user-defined entities. NLU relays this information to Virtual Agent, and the user is usually taken directly to the conversation topic that offers resolution.

With intent-only support, the focus is on intent recognition. With Virtual Agent using NLU, users are directed to the desired conversation topic, where qualifying follow-up questions may be asked before being taken to a topic that offers resolution.

Utterances for all languages are case insensitive during intent prediction.

Below is a detailed list of the currently available NLU languages and the intents, entities, vocabulary, features, and applications they support.

# Service update summary

The NLU Service helps the system to understand natural language and drive intelligent actions. This service trains and predicts intents and entities for a given user utterance in your NLU model so it can understand human-expressed natural language, whether spoken or written. The source of this documentation is KB0953693.

This service is updated independently of your instance upgrade, and without any action required by you. These updates are done on a bi-monthly basis (once every two months) to improve the quality of NLU model training and predictions. Major updates are aligned with family releases such as Rome, San Diego, Tokyo, etc. Minor updates are automatically updated so you are using the latest version when you retrain an NLU model. While most of these updates don't impact your existing use of NLU, there may be some changes you need to be aware of.

# May 2023 NLU Service update

- Introduced dialog acts to enable natural mid-conversation in Virtual Agent (VA) and improve conversation fluidity. Affirm, negate, and modify dialog acts are supported in English and enabled by default for all new VA topics.
- Migrated all languages to use new language models, boosting average intent prediction quality by 10% across all languages.
- Enabled customers to manage and edit irrelevant utterances for their models to improve irrelevance detection.
- Removed the requirement for a model to have 2 or more intents in the model, making it easier for end-to-end topic testing in VA.

# March 2023 NLU Service update

- Improved intent/entity detection through better handling of common words in vocabulary sources.
- Improved latency and memory utilization for system entity (NER) detection.
- Updated version support so that customers will need to use newer versions of the NLU Service and cannot point to n-2 releases older than their current glide version.

# January 2023 NLU Service update

- Created the new DATE-TIME system entity (English only) for use in Virtual Agent.
- Added vocabulary source and entity support (simple, mapped, and open ended) for the Dutch and Italian languages, and system entity support for Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese.
- Upgraded the ServiceNow Language Model for the Danish, Swedish, Finnish, and Norwegian languages, improving their average prediction quality by 17% from Tokyo.
- Improved the handling of punctuation in entities and special characters in vocabulary sources.
- Incorporated feedback provided on intent predictions by admin users in the NLU Workbench to improve model training data for Virtual Agent.

# NLU models

Use NLU models to apply ServiceNow Natural Language Understanding on your instances. Create, manage, test, and publish NLU models with the NLU Workbench.

# Overview of how user input is transformed to a system action

A model is a collection of utterances, intents, entities, and vocabulary that the system uses to respond to natural language inputs from your users. The model takes the natural language input from your users and matches it to actions to be performed by the system.

The utterances in your model data are examples of what your users might ask for. These examples are used to train your model to recognize which system actions to perform in response. These system actions are called intents.

# Usage, roles, and navigation

Use the nlu_admin role to access the NLU Workbench.

Navigate to NLU Workbench > Models.

There are three tabs on the NLU Workbench homepage: Virtual Agent, Issue Auto Resolution, and AI Search. The Virtual Agent tab opens by default. Select the correct tab for your application.

You can use the Search field to look for models by name.

# Model Management

The default setting of the All Languages filter displays all models regardless of their language. You can filter models by language using the list in All Languages. To learn more about the available languages, see NLU language support.

If you have a multilingual grouped model, its row in the list of models has an arrow on the left side. Select the arrow to expand the group so that all language versions of the model are displayed. For more information on model languages and grouping, see Multilingual model management.

The Used In VA column indicates whether a model has already been linked to another application such as Virtual Agent. For AI Search, this column indicates whether the model has already been linked to a Genius Result. Similarly, the Mapped Intents column displays a count of intents that have been mapped or linked to Virtual Agent topics.

Scroll down the NLU Workbench homepage to view the Boost your model performance section. This section displays cards you can use to access functions that are available to your model type.

# Model applications

The output of your NLU models can be consumed by the ServiceNow applications Virtual Agent, Issue Auto Resolution, and AI Search. The NLU Workbench homepage organizes each application's models by tab. In the list of models, different columns are displayed depending on the application.

# Add an NLU model to an update set

Use update sets to move your Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models from one instance to another. Update sets include all records needed for your model to function on the target instance.

# Before you begin

- Make sure that the NLU Workbench plugin, NLU Workbench - Core plugin, and Predictive Intelligence plugin are all installed and activated on your instance.
- The following instructions apply to NLU models for Virtual Agent and AI Search.
- Role required: admin

# About this task

Use update sets to transfer a model from a source instance to a target instance. The target instance must already have the same scope as the model's scope in the source instance.

Adding a model to an update set includes the following resources:

- Model content (intents, utterances, entities, annotations, vocabulary, and the default test set)
- Associated vocabulary sources
- Corresponding latest active ML solution
- ML model artifacts
- ML solution and definition (last three runs, provided one of them was successful)

For more information on update sets, see System update sets.

If you want to add the model to a different update set, you must make that update set the current one. See Create and select an update set as the current set.

For optimum portability, add your NLU model to a new, dedicated update set rather than to a system Default update set. To do this, a new update set must be manually created in the model's scope. An error is displayed if the current update set is the scope's Default. This error contains a link for manually creating a new update set.

If the model contains records from multiple scopes, such as vocabulary tables, its update set must have a parent-child (batch) structure. Follow the procedure from step 5 to create a parent-child update set.

When models (either Global or scoped) are moved using update sets, their training and publishing state remains the same after transfer. So a model that is trained and published before it is added to an update set does not require retraining or republishing on the target instance.

For information about parent-child update sets, see Update set batching. The following video provides a demonstration of this process. A video walkthrough of migrating NLU models by update sets in the Vancouver release.

# Procedure

1. Select All and enter sys_nlu_model.list into the navigator.
2. Select the Model Name of the model.

The Display name is the name you gave the model when creating it. The Model name is given to the model by the system.

Optional: If Global is your current application, follow the prompt at the top to edit the record.

(Optional)

In the Related Links section, click Add model to current update set.

If the model's records are all in one scope, the system adds the model to the current update set. Once completed, the record can be found in the sys_update_set table.

However, the system displays an error if the designated scope is the Default scope. Continue with the following steps.

If the system displays the error You are attempting to add a record to the system default update set, continue with the remaining steps in this procedure.

# Creating a New Local Update Set

In the error banner, select the New Local Update Set link to create a new update set which is not Default. In the case of a parent-child update set, the parent is first created in the model's scope. (Any child update sets are created in a later step).

New Local Update Set opens a new record in the sys_update_set table.

1. For the new update set record, provide a name, review other values including Application scope, then select Submit and Make Current.

A new update set is created, and the screen re-opens to the model's record in the sys_nlu_model table.

In the model's record in sys_nlu_model, select Add model to current update set under Related Links.

When the model's records are in multiple scopes, this step creates child update sets that have Global scope.

Note: If the model's records are all in one scope, the system adds the model to the current update set. Once completed, the record can be found in the sys_update_set table.

If the model is in a non-Global scope: In the Update Sets table sys_update_set, locate the parent update set and its child update sets (refresh the page if necessary).
- The parent update set has the value (empty) in the Parent column.
- Child update sets have the name of the parent in the Parent column, and Global in the Application column.
- Both parent and child update sets contain the same value in the Batch Base column.

# 9. Open the parent's record in sys_update_set and set the State field to Complete.

A Confirmation dialog box pops up. Select Yes to confirm. This sets the parent and all child update sets to Complete.

# 10. To migrate the update set file, select Export Update Set Batch to XML in the parent's record in sys_update_set.

The parent and child update sets are packaged together and exported.

# What to do next

In the target instance, navigate to Retrieved Update Sets and select Import Update Sets from XML. When unpackaged, the parent and all children will be listed in the Retrieved Update Sets table. Open the parent and select Preview Update Set Batch.

If a referenced record in the source instance is not present on the target instance, you may encounter errors while applying the update set. For example, the origin field on sys_nlu_intent could refer to an intent from a different model that doesn't exist on the target instance. You can click Accept remote update on the failed records to commit the update set anyway.

- Intents: An action the user wants to do or wants the application to do.
- Entities: Object or context for an action.
- Vocabulary: Add vocabulary to help your model understand the range of words in your users' utterances.
- Test set: To assess model performance, add test utterances and the intents that you expect to be predicted for those utterances.

To access the model content, navigate to NLU Workbench > Models. The Virtual Agent tab opens by default. Select the tab for your model's application and then select the name of the model to open the Model details page. In the Build and train your model card, select View phase.

# Intents

When your model receives user input, it uses an intent to perform a system action. For example, a user types in I have a critical issue with a slow laptop. The model matches the utterance input to the intent #TroubleshootSlowComputer. If the intent is linked to a Virtual Agent topic, it triggers further action.

Intents contain training utterances, or examples of user inputs that would trigger the system action. Provide realistic utterances that the model might encounter from your users. The quality of training utterances affects the accuracy of your model.

For more information, see NLU intents.

# Entities

Your intents use entities to provide additional context for the model when receiving inputs. In the computer example, the laptop is the entity, or object of, the action.

NLU entities fall into two categories: system-defined and user-defined. System entities such as DATE, TIME, and LOCATION are available by default in your instance. You can create your own user-defined entities to provide additional associations and meaning for your business requirements.

All entities are reusable across other NLU models. However, you must add them to a training utterance for each model to use them.

For more information, see NLU entities.

# Vocabulary

Your users' input may contain a wide variety of words and phrases. Also, your model may not understand some terms used in specialized domains or business areas.

To improve your model's ability to understand a wide range of user input, you can define synonyms by creating vocabulary items.

For example, your model includes an entity for the term computer. When a user types in I need a new computer, the model knows how to respond. However, if a user enters laptop or workstation, the model might fail to predict the intent. You can add vocabulary to the model to train it to understand synonyms and variations.

You can also use tables and lists as vocabulary sources. Your models can look up the vocabulary sources when predicting intents.

For more information, see NLU vocabulary.

# Test set

Your model contains a default test set that you can use to evaluate the model’s performance. Initially the test set is empty, ready to be populated with your content. Add test utterances and their expected intents to build the test set.

For more information, see Test set creation and management.

# Test panel

Access the test panel by clicking Train model or Try model in the Build and train your model phase. Training incorporates new content into your model. With Try model, you can manually enter individual utterances to test what intents the model predicts for them.

For more information, see Train and try your NLU model.

You can also use the test panel to provide feedback on your model's predictions. Your feedback helps improve intent prediction. See Test panel feedback.

# Settings

Use the Settings tab to edit the name, short description, and confidence threshold of the model. You can't change the language or purpose of the model.

For more information on the confidence threshold, see Test and publish your model. For more information on Settings, see NLU model settings.

# NLU intents

Intents drive your models' responses by matching a system action to user inputs. Models with good intents help Virtual Agent and Search respond to your users accurately.

Think of intents as the core that drives the comprehension of natural language. Intents help the models translate utterances from your users into actions that the system can perform. Intents perform best if your utterances, entities, and vocabulary work together to support your model. Using vocabulary and realistic utterance examples can help the system to be more accurate when predicting intents.

# Creating Your Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Model

When creating your Natural Language Understanding (NLU) model, you add intents to match user inputs with system actions. The more intents that a model has, the more actions it can take when it receives utterances from your users. Model intents can perform various actions, from creating hardware service requests to adding users to groups.

To access your model's intents, navigate to a model's overview page. In the Build and train your model phase, select View phase. The Intents tab shows by default.

A model can contain up to 750 intents. However, models with over 300 intents or 4500 utterances, whichever comes first, take longer to train, test, and publish.

Note: As you create intents, keep in mind that they can sometimes impact each other. For example, you build and test an intent that works on one or two utterances. But when you test it in a larger intent environment, it might behave differently. To reduce the likelihood of such an event, you may want to create at least five intents in a model before you start proper testing.

To start adding content to your model, see Create an NLU intent.

The Enabled column shows whether or not the intent is active in predictions. An NLU admin can deactivate an individual intent but keep it in the model.

However, if an intent is mapped to a published Virtual Agent topic:

- You cannot deactivate the intent.
- You cannot delete the intent.

After changing the Enabled status of an intent, retrain the model.

# Utterances

Intents contain training utterances, which are examples of inputs that the model may see from your users. Each intent in a model has its own utterances. When trained, the model learns to recognize similar utterances from your users and then respond with the matching intent.



---


# Select an intent to access the intent details page.

The Utterances tab lists all the utterances currently in the intent.

After adding utterances, you can edit, copy, move, or delete the utterances using the icons in the right column. You can move or delete multiple utterances by selecting the box on the left first and using the Perform action on selected rows button.

# Here are some things to consider when adding utterances to intents:

- A model must have at least 1 intent, with a minimum of 5 utterances in each intent.
- An intent needs at least 5 utterances to begin training.
- The system currently supports utterances up to 25 words or 200 characters. Utterances that exceed that limit fail to return an intent prediction.
- The system currently supports up to 20,000 utterances in a single model.
- Models with more than 4,500 utterances take longer to train, test, and publish.

Provide vocabulary for any words or phrases that are relevant to your organization or domain when adding utterances to your model. The vocabulary helps with intent prediction for words and phrases that your users are likely to use. You can use the @ symbol when adding an utterance to call on a vocabulary source. For more context and examples, see NLU vocabulary.

# Associated entities

Your model uses entities to provide additional context and meaning when predicting user input. You add entities to the training utterances of your intent to provide the system with more information to perform the intended action.

# Intent issues

Building large models increases the chance that intents overlap, conflict, or fail to contain enough training utterances. For example, the utterance examples in one intent may end up identical to the examples in another intent. If your intents conflict, the model may not know which intent to predict when receiving user input.

If your model has issues or conflicts, the Intents page displays cards showing the number of intents affected.

Select a card to see a filtered list of intents with that issue. Resolving issues ensures that your intents meet the requirements and work as intended.

For more information, see Resolve intent issues.

# Create an NLU intent

Create an intent for your Natural Language Understanding (NLU) model. Intents provide your model with a system action to perform when it receives user input.

# Before you begin

- Make sure that the NLU Workbench plugin, NLU Workbench - Core plugin, NLU Workbench - Advanced Features plugin, NLU Common Model plugin, and Predictive Intelligence plugin are all installed and activated on your instance.
- Ensure that you are in the same application scope as your model.

# Creating Intents for Virtual Agent and AI Search Models

- You can create intents for Virtual Agent and AI Search models in NLU Workbench.
- Role required: admin or nlu_admin

# About this task

This procedure shows you how to create an intent. To reuse intents from other models, see Reusing intents from prebuilt NLU models.

Here's an example of how intents can interact with the vocabulary in their training utterances.

- Intent: #AddMembersToDistributionList
- Utterance A: "Please add Carlos Santana to the uxinfodev list"
- Utterance B: "I'm mistakenly removed from the arlo-drury-directreports group"
- Result: The system doesn't recognize uxinfodev or arlo-drury-directreports and can't use these words to predict the intent.
- Solution: Add uxinfodev and arlo-drury-directreports as vocabulary items and add synonyms to them. The synonyms you provide help add more context to the utterance and the intent in which they reside. Your intent prediction confidence can be even higher if you also mark them as entities.

Note: Training utterances and utterances from your users have a limit of 25 words or 200 characters. Utterances that exceed that limit fail to return an intent prediction.

Do not include unrealistic terms such as "OrderLaptop" or "sfsdfasdfas" in training utterances. Utterances should be correct and natural examples in the model's language.

In the following example procedure, you're creating an intent and adding utterances that users might say when requesting information on payment. You've already created an NLU model that you've titled HR Model for Virtual Agent and you're creating an intent in that model.

# Procedure

1. Set your application scope to your model's scope.
2. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Models. The Virtual Agent tab opens by default.
3. Select the tab corresponding to your model's application, then select the name of the model you want to add an intent to. In this model example, you select your HR Model for Virtual Agent model.
4. In the Build and train your model card, select View phase.
5. Select Intents.
6. Select New Intent.
7. In the Create an intent window, add a name and description for the intent.

# Creating an intent

In this example scenario, you enter PayDiscrepancy for the name. You can also add a description.

Note: When you create an intent, the system adds a hashtag to the intent name.

1. Select Add intent. The #PayDiscrepancy intent screen appears, including sections for its utterances, associated entities, and settings. The intent draft status is also shown in the upper right corner of the Intent screen.
2. In the Utterances tab, enter training utterance examples that are relevant to the intent.

Note: The utterance examples that you provide must be unique and contain fewer than 25 words or 200 characters. Aim to add at least 15 utterances with as much variety between them as possible. You must add at least 5 utterances to begin training the model.

In this scenario, you add the following utterances into the field and select Add.

As you build and retrain your model iteratively, you can check how your updated intent affects the model's predictions. See Train and try your NLU model.

# What to do next

Train your model to save your updates. For issues with intents, see Resolve intent issues.

To improve your utterances, add entities to provide context. See NLU entities.

# Intent Discovery Feature

The available Intent Discovery feature can help identify intents that would be possible to add, based on your historical data.

# Reusing intents from prebuilt NLU models

Reuse Natural Language Understanding (NLU) intents by importing them from a prebuilt NLU model to other models. Reusing intents saves time when building your models.

Prebuilt Virtual Agent NLU models provide language understanding needed for chatbot conversation flows in ITSM, CSM, and HR topics. Each NLU intent in these models maps to a single Virtual Agent conversation topic created in Virtual Agent Designer accordingly.

The prebuilt models are read-only, but contain validated intents that you can reuse in your NLU models. For example, the prebuilt HR model for Virtual Agent contains several intents regarding HR requests. Adding the intents to one of your models makes that model ready to respond to user inputs regarding HR.

# Prebuilt Virtual Agent model content

Each of the prebuilt Virtual Agent models uses language that's pertinent to their respective business unit (BU). The NLU that processes this language, built from a word corpus of 3 million words, is context-aware of general linguistic patterns and both ServiceNow and user-defined vocabularies.

The prebuilt models map to common conversation topics used by Virtual Agent chatbots across each of the three BUs. Those topics correspond with intents that perform BU-specific actions.

For more NLU and Virtual Agent context, refer to the following product documentation:

# Creating NLU models that reuse predefined Virtual Agent intents

The prebuilt Virtual Agent models are set to read-only and can't be edited. However, the intents in these models can be imported into your new model, alongside any new intents you've created in your model. You can also copy the prebuilt model and use the intents as a foundation for a new model.

To reuse the intents from a prebuilt Virtual Agent model, choose the prebuilt model when importing intents. See Import an NLU intent.

NLU models and their intents and entities are associated to an application scope. The scope can't be changed later, so verify your target application scope before you begin.

# Import an NLU intent

As you create intents for your Natural Language Understanding (NLU) model, you can also import and reuse intents from other models in the same application scope. Reusing intents saves time when building new models.

# Before you begin

- Make sure that the NLU Workbench plugin, NLU Workbench - Core plugin, and Predictive Intelligence plugin are all installed and activated on your instance.
- You can import intents for Virtual Agent and AI Search models.
- Verify that the application scope of your source model and target model are the same.
- Role required: nlu_editor, nlu_admin, or admin

# About this task

When you import an intent, the following associated items are also imported:

# Importing Intents

- training utterances, with their entity annotations
- entities

The following items are not included when importing an intent:

- test utterances in the default test set
- regular and pattern vocabulary

Note: You cannot import intents in the following situations:

- When the model already has an intent with the same name as the intent you are trying to import.
- When the model already has an entity with the same name but different attributes as what you are trying to import.

In this example scenario, you are building the content of your NLU model and you want to enhance the model by reusing intents from another model.

# Procedure

1. Ensure that you are in the target application scope, and navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Models. The Virtual Agent tab opens by default.
2. Select the tab for your model's application, then select the name of the model you want to add an intent to.
3. In the model overview page, find the Build and train your model phase and select View phase.
4. In the Intents tab, select Import intents.

The Import intents screen appears, showing a list of NLU models from which you can select intents to import.

Locate the intents you want to import, and select their check boxes.

# In this scenario, you select the OpenITTicket intent in the ITSM NLU Model for Virtual Agent Conversations model.

1. Select Import.

Result: The #OpenITTticket intent appears in the intents list of your target model. By importing this particular intent, you have added 29 additional training utterances to your model.

# What to do next

- Review the annotations of the newly imported training utterances. Add vocabulary annotation if needed.
- Train your model to save your updates. For issues with intents, see Resolve intent issues.
- If there are any secondary language models associated to your target model, consider importing and translating the new content. See Import primary model content to a secondary model.
- For information about prebuilt Virtual Agent models that you can import from, see Reusing intents from prebuilt NLU models.

# Resolve intent issues

Use the issue cards to identify intents that have conflicts, need reviewing, or need more utterances. Resolving intent issues ensures the intents in your Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models work properly.

# Before you begin

- Make sure that the NLU Workbench plugin, NLU Workbench - Core plugin, NLU Workbench - Advanced Features plugin, and Predictive Intelligence plugin are all installed and activated on your instance.
- You can resolve conflicts for Virtual Agent and AI Search models.
- Role required: nlu_admin or admin. When assigned to a model, the nlu_editor can resolve intent issues for that model.

# About this task

When a trained model contains intents with issues, the issue cards are displayed on the intents tab of Build and train your model page. Select each card to filter the list of intents for that issue.

# The cards display different issues:

- intents have low utterance count: Intent doesn’t contain the required minimum of 5 training utterances. This card also displays when the intent contains less than the recommended count of 15 utterances.
- intents have low test utterance count: The default test set does not have enough test utterances for the intent. This card displays when the count of test utterances for an intent is below the recommended 15.
- intents have critical conflicts: Intent contains training utterances that overlap with utterances in another intent.
- Note: Utterances which are marked as Not relevant may also conflict with utterances assigned to intents. For more information, see Irrelevance detection in NLU.
- intents need review: Intent was translated but must be reviewed by an nlu_admin or nlu_editor.

# The issue cards are hidden under the following circumstances:

- The model is a pre-built model
- The model is in a draft state and not trained
- The model contains no conflicts
- A successful conflict report doesn't exist for the latest trained version
- The NLU Workbench - Advanced Features plugin isn't installed

# Resolve issues in the following ways:

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Issue</th>
<th>Resolution</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>intents have low utterance count</td>
<td>Add more training utterances to the intent. Intents need at least 5 utterances. The recommended count is at least 15 utterances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>intents have low test utterance count</td>
<td>Add more test utterances for the intent to the model's default test set. The recommended count is at least 15.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>intents have critical conflicts</td>
<td>Remove or edit any utterances so that each utterance applies to only one intent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>intents need review</td>
<td>Have an nlu_admin or nlu_editor review the intent. For more information, see Enable or disable a secondary model intent.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

In this example procedure, you are resolving critical conflicts in one of your intents. You built a Virtual Agent model for handling HR requests, but two of your intents, GeneralHRInquiry and CreateHRGeneralInquiryCase included similar utterances.

# Procedure

1. Ensure that you are in the same application scope as your model, and navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Models. The Virtual Agent tab opens by default.
2. Select the tab corresponding to your model's application, then select the name of your model.
3. In the Build and train your model card, click View phase.
4. On the intents tab, click the intents have critical conflicts card. The intents list filters and shows the intents with critical conflicts.
5. Click the intent name you want to resolve. In this example, you click the GeneralHRInquiry intent.
6. Click the Conflicts tab.

The conflicts tab appears and lists the conflicting utterances. The utterances for the current intent show on the left. The conflicting utterances for the other intent appear on the right.

Note: You can hide moderate conflicts to focus on the critical conflicts. You can also ignore conflicts. However, be sure to fix all conflicts for best performance.



---

# 7. Point to the utterance that you want to edit or remove.

In this example procedure, click the trash icon to remove the utterance from the CreateHRGeneralInquiryCase intent. The utterance is removed from the intent.

Note: Any changes you make automatically save.

# What to do next

Utterances designated as Irrelevant or Not relevant may also conflict with training utterances. Irrelevant utterances are displayed as though they are in their own intent named NO_INTENT. However, these utterances cannot be edited or deleted in Conflicts. Copy the utterance to the Irrelevance Detection module to edit or delete. For more information, see Irrelevance detection in NLU.

Continue to resolve all conflicts. When finished, train your model to see a list of updated conflicts, if any. Resolve all intent issues prior to testing and publishing your model.

# NLU entities

Entities provide your model with additional context when receiving user input. Add entities to your utterances and intents to improve the predictions of your Natural Language Understanding (NLU) model.

Think of entities as the object of the action that the user wants to perform. The model interprets the utterance by matching it with an intent, but also uses entities to gather more details on the request.

# Understanding NLU Entities

For example, if a user types in I have a critical issue with a slow laptop, the system predicts a match to the intent #TroubleshootSlowComputer. From this utterance, the model also identifies the following entities:

- HARDWARE (entity) - laptop (value)
- urgency (entity) - High (value)

NLU entities fall into two categories: system and user-defined. System entities such as DATE, TIME, and LOCATION are available by default in your instance. You can create your own user-defined entities to provide context relevant to your business.

There are five types of user-defined entities. Select one of the following links to learn more.

- Create a simple entity
- Create a mapped entity
- Create a pattern entity
- Create a system-derived entity
- Create an open-ended entity

When you create entities, annotate them on utterances to provide examples to help your model learn. By annotating entities, you provide your model with linguistic associations and meaningful context for the system vocabulary. Annotations strengthen the relevance of entities and help your model perform the correct action in response to your users' inputs.

You add entities to your utterances when you are creating the intents. The entities then become associated to that intent, giving you the Associated Intents number.

# Regular expressions

Regular expressions (regex) help your model establish patterns that improve that model's ability to locate, match, and manage text. Use regular expressions with pattern entities to help your model understand formats such as email addresses, phone numbers, and incident numbers.

To learn more, see Using regular expressions in entities.

# Model availability

When you create an entity, you can choose to make the entity available for reuse by other intents in the model. If you didn't select the Model availability box when creating the entity, you can edit the entity afterwards.

On the Model details page, select Entities. Select the name of the entity to bring up the entity details page. Then, select the Settings tab.

# Entity settings page

# Create a simple entity

Create one or more simple entities from words in your utterance examples. An entity is an object of, or context for, an action.

# Before you begin

- Make sure that the NLU Workbench plugin, NLU Workbench - Core plugin, NLU Common Model plugin, and Predictive Intelligence plugin are all installed and activated on your instance.
- Create or use an existing NLU model for Virtual Agent or AI Search.
- Create or use an existing intent.
- Role required: nlu_editor, nlu_admin, or admin. The nlu_editor must be assigned to the model.

# About this task

Simple entities are words or phrases whose value can be extracted by your model. Simple entities are identified based on the context in which the entity is used in an utterance.

For the following example procedure, you've already created an intent that's titled SubmitAccessRequest and you're creating a simple entity for the type of access the user is requesting.

# What to do next

Your utterances can reference a vocabulary source by using the @ handle. If you have a list of values that are defined in a vocabulary source, you can annotate the @ handle as a simple entity to extract it rather than repeating the utterance for all of the values. The referenced vocabulary source can be a table or a list. For example, the following image shows how you invoke a vocabulary source that lists various conference room names.

# Example utterance using a vocabulary source

For more information, see NLU vocabulary.

# Create a mapped entity

Create an entity mapped to a vocabulary source, or to a list of values you manually create for the entity. Mapped entities can help provide multiple values the model can use as context when interpreting utterances.

# Before you begin

- Make sure that the NLU Workbench plugin, NLU Workbench - Core plugin, NLU Common Model plugin, and Predictive Intelligence plugin are all installed and activated on your instance.
- Create or use an existing NLU model for Virtual Agent or AI Search.
- Create or use an existing intent.
- Role required: nlu_editor, nlu_admin, or admin. The nlu_editor must be assigned to the model.

# About this task

Mapped entities take the words of the utterance and extract value based on a designated source. The model uses the source when predicting the intent.

When you create a mapped entity, you have the following three options for the source.

- Manual list of values: Use this option to manually enter a list of values for the entity. For example, you could create a mapped entity named priority and map it to the word urgent in an utterance, then manually build a list for it with values of High, Medium, and Low.
- Table vocabulary source: Use this option if you have a ServiceNow table that has the values you're looking for. Mapping an entity to a table vocabulary source enables the entity to reference multiple values from the table. For example, use a @Location vocabulary source, where @Location has values for cities and countries.
- List vocabulary source: Use this option if you don't have a ServiceNow table that has the values you're looking for. For example, use a @mouse vocabulary source, where @mouse has values for various models of hand-held computer devices.

In this example procedure, you create a mapped entity for urgency.

# What to do next

You can create a mapped entity using a vocabulary source to use the values in the source as the mapped entity.

# Related topics

- Create a table vocabulary source
- Create a list vocabulary source

# Create a pattern entity

Create a pattern entity from a word or phrase with repeatable patterns, such as email addresses and phone numbers. These patterns help the system to recognize similar utterances based on the patterns.

# Before you begin

- Make sure that the NLU Workbench plugin, NLU Workbench - Core plugin, NLU Common Model plugin, and Predictive Intelligence plugin are all installed and activated on your instance.
- Create or use an existing NLU model for Virtual Agent or AI Search.
- Create or use an existing intent.
- Role required: nlu_editor, nlu_admin, or admin. The nlu_editor must be assigned to the model.

# About this task

Pattern entities help your model identify, contextualize, and govern similar types of content. Inputs such as phone numbers and email addresses follow the same pattern. By creating a pattern entity, you can train the model to recognize all variations of those inputs.

Note: Pattern entities use regular expressions (regex). The regex field value is a Java regular expression. For more information on how to use regex, see Using regular expressions in entities.

In this example scenario, you've created an intent that's titled #CheckITTicketStatus. In this example procedure, you're creating a pattern entity for incident record numbers.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Models. The Virtual Agent tab opens by default.
2. Select the tab for your model's application, then the name of the model.
3. On the model details page, select Intents.
4. Select the name of an intent. In this example scenario, you select #CheckITTicketStatus.
5. Select one of the words of an utterance. In this scenario, you click INC1234567.

---


# 8. Click Save.

The pattern entity saves and appears in the Associated Entities tab. The model can use the pattern entity to interpret variations of the annotated utterance. For example, the model can match the #CheckITTicketStatus intent if a user enters any incident record number.

# Create a system-derived entity

Create a custom entity that's derived from a default system entity such as date, time, duration, or location.

# Before you begin

- Make sure that the NLU Workbench plugin, NLU Workbench - Core plugin, NLU Common Model plugin, and Predictive Intelligence plugin are all installed and activated on your instance.
- Create or use an existing NLU model for Virtual Agent or AI Search.
- Create or use an existing intent.
- Role required: nlu_editor, nlu_admin, or admin. The nlu_editor must be assigned to the model.

# About this task

System entities are pre-built in your ServiceNow instance by default, and appear on the Entities section of the Model screen. These entities, such as DATE, TIME, and DATE_TIME, are enabled by default. You can disable and re-enable them if needed by clicking Enable.

System-derived entities extend your system entities, providing more context. For example, your model already understands date formats thanks to the system entity DATE. However, you can create system-derived entities, such as startdate and enddate, to extract more information from user utterances regarding dates.

For the following example scenario, you're creating a model for booking flights, cars, hotels, and events. You want your intent #FlightBooking to interpret utterances with your users flight requests. Your model contains the system entity LOCATION, but flight plans usually involve two locations.

In this example procedure, you create two system-derived entities to gather the departure and arrival locations of the flight.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Models. The Virtual Agent tab opens by default.
2. Select the tab for your model's application, then the name of your model.
3. In the model details page, select Intents.
4. Select the name of the intent. For this example, you select the #FlightBooking intent.
5. On the Utterances tab, select a word or phrase from one of the utterances. In this example scenario, you have an example utterance book a flight from San Diego to San Francisco. For this step, click from San Diego.

Result: Your two system-derived entities appear in the entity window.

# What to do next

Train your model to save the entities. You can try your model to see if it recognizes and interprets variations of the entities that you created.

For this example, you can test your model with a different departure and arrival location.

1. Select Try model.
2. Enter book a flight from Dallas to San Jose.
3. Select Go.

# Intents details page with the test panel

The model predicts the intent, showing the entities it used to determine the values. Notice how it uses both the system entity and system-derived entity when predicting.

# Create an open-ended entity

Use an open-ended entity when you want to improve intent prediction accuracy. Open-ended entities help your model focus on the context of the utterances.

# Before you begin

- Make sure that the NLU Workbench plugin, NLU Workbench - Core plugin, NLU Common Model plugin, and Predictive Intelligence plugin are all installed and activated on your instance.
- Create or use an existing NLU model for Virtual Agent or AI Search.
- Create or use an existing intent.
- Role required: nlu_editor, nlu_admin, or admin. The nlu_editor must be assigned to the model.

# About this task

Open-ended entities tell the model to focus on the context of the entity rather than the entity itself. When you mark a word or phrase as open-ended, the system skips the entity and predicts the intent from the context that precedes or follows the entity in the utterance.

For example, in the utterance I want to order an iPhone, you annotate the words "an iPhone" as an open-ended entity. The model focuses on the context, predicting the user wants to order something. Since there are numerous things the user could want to order, naming all of them would be an unbearable task for the model author.

Using an open-ended entity instead of a simple entity helps the model focus on the rest of the utterance and not the entity. In the iPhone example, the entity itself is less relevant; so you want the system to ignore it.

In other scenarios you should use a simple entity, as there could be multiple intents where you shouldn't have the system ignore the entity.

Note: You can't annotate a vocabulary source (referenced by @vocab_source in an utterance) as an open ended entity. You can only annotate a vocabulary source as a simple entity or a mapped entity. For example, if the utterance is “I want to order a laptop”, then the word “laptop” can be annotated as an open ended entity. However, if the utterance is “I want to order @laptop” where @laptop refers to a table vocabulary source or a list vocabulary source, it can't be annotated as an open ended entity.

For this example scenario, you've created an NLU model with an intent for your users to order company merchandise.

In the following example procedure, you create an entity from one of your utterances so the system can recognize it as open-ended and reusable in other NLU models in your instance.

Note: You can use only one open-ended entity per intent.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Models. The Virtual Agent tab opens by default.
2. Select the tab for your model's application, then select the name of your model.
3. On the Model details page, click Intents.
4. Select the name of the intent you want to add the entity to. For this example, you select the #OrderMerch intent.
5. In the Utterances tab, select a word or phrase of one of the utterances to bring up the entities window. For this example, you select a hoodie.

# Current Page

The merch open-ended entity is annotated in the Utterances section of your model's Intent screen. When you point to its name, you can see that it persists as a new entity in the annotation details. This entity is reusable in all other NLU models in your instance.

# What to do next

Train your model to save the entities. You can try your model to see if it interprets the utterance based on the context of the entity, rather than the entity itself.

For this example, you can test your model with a different merchandise item.

1. Select Try Model.
2. Enter I want to order a polo.
3. Select Go.

The model predicts the intent and shows that it used the merch entity for the a polo value.

# Import entities

Reuse entities that you have created across your other Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models. Importing entities saves time and helps improve the intents in your model.

# Using regular expressions in entities

Learn how to use regular expressions in your NLU entities to establish patterns that help the system locate, match, and manage text.

Pattern entities use regular expressions (regex) to match any pattern of text, such as the format of an email address, a phone number, or an incident or case ID.

Note: ServiceNow uses and supports Java regex exclusively and not other vendor options, such as Perl regex.

# Regex examples

For a full example of regex code used in a pattern entity, see Create a pattern entity.

The following four examples provide the format and regex code for different pattern entities.

# Knowledge base article

ServiceNow Knowledge Base (KB) articles use the format KB1234567. The regex code is KB\d{7}, where KB = knowledge base record and d{7} = 7 digits.

# Case number

Case tasks use the format CS1234567. The regex code is CS\d{7} where CS = case record and d{7} = 7 digits.

---

# Email address

Email addresses use the format name@servicenow.com. The regex code is \b[a-zA-Z0-9&#x26;*/_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+\b, which supports these formats: name@servicenow.com and name@servicenow.co.in.

# Phone number

United States phone numbers use the format 555-123-4567. The regex code is \d{10}|(?:\d{3}-){2}\d{4}|\(\d{3}\)\d{3}-?\d{4}, which supports these formats: 5108882062, 510-888-2062, and (510)888-2062.

# Vocabulary usage and context

Vocabulary helps your model with the various words and phrases that it may encounter from your users. Since humans are not computers, they may come up with different ways to say the same thing. For example, if one user inputs an acronym rather than the full phrase, the system might be able to predict the correct intent by using the context in the utterance. However, by defining the acronym with a vocabulary item, you raise the model's confidence level and capability to predict intents correctly.

---


# Vocabulary items cover the varying words or phrases that might appear in utterances.

The vocabulary items are mapped to the synonyms that you provide, for intent prediction. This helps the system recognize the various ways your users express their requests, while at the same time ensuring the consistency, confidence, and accuracy of predictions.

# Vocabulary item types

NLU provides the following vocabulary types that you can use to create and configure a vocabulary item.

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Type</td>
<td>Definition</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Regular</td>
<td>A word or phrase that is not commonly known, such as a business or industry specific term or acronym. Regular vocabulary is case insensitive, so all case variations will be captured by the vocabulary you create.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>See Create a regular vocabulary item.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pattern</td>
<td>A regular expression (regex) that can capture specific formats such as email addresses and phone numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>See Create a pattern vocabulary item.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

# Vocabulary sources

You can also use vocabulary sources to cover various objects that your users might request. Vocabulary items and vocabulary sources differ in their usage:

- Use a vocabulary item for an individual word, phrase, or pattern that can easily be mapped to a single synonym for the model to use.
- Use a vocabulary source to reference a ServiceNow table or list so that the values can all be replaced by the single synonym you define. Vocabulary sources can be reused across all your NLU models.

---


Use vocabulary sources when your user utterances refer to objects in a set. The sources can be referenced from a list of values from a ServiceNow table or a static list that you define, such as a list of catalog items or conference rooms. Once you create and save these sources, you can use the @ symbol to specify them in training utterances. You can also use these sources as entity values.

For example, say you already have a list of all the conference rooms for your office. You can create a vocabulary source to reference that list rather than typing each conference room name into your intent's training utterances.

To create vocabulary sources, refer to Create a table vocabulary source and Create a list vocabulary source.

# Vocabulary usage in relation to an intent

Here's an example of how an intent can interact with the vocabulary in its utterance examples.

Note: In NLU vocabulary, the synonym replaces the vocabulary that appears in the utterance.

# Intent: OrderSoftware

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Utterance</th>
<th>Issue and Solution</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"I need to access sfcrm"</td>
<td> • Issue: the system doesn't recognize the acronym sfcrm, so can't accurately predict the intent. • Solution: Add sfcrm as a regular vocabulary item, and provide a synonym such as CRM software. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"I need to install Word"</td>
<td> • Issue: The term word is very common and does not necessarily indicate a software product. The term install may provide helpful context, but the confidence score may be too low to predict the OrderSoftware intent. • Solution: Create a pattern vocabulary item with a regex for capitalized Word, so that the system can recognize it as a software product. This added constraint makes it more likely that the OrderSoftware intent will be predicted. </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

Note: To extract the specific software name to use in a Virtual Agent conversation topic, annotate it as an entity in the utterance.

Use a single word or short phrase as a synonym for best results. You can map multiple vocabulary items to one synonym. Do not map one vocabulary item to multiple synonyms.

For more context and examples, see Create an NLU intent.

# A Regex example for a pattern vocabulary item

Let's say that you want to use a vocabulary item to identify the acronym IT, and map it to the synonym information technology.

Regular vocabulary items are case-insensitive by default. This means that a regular vocabulary item would match both the acronym IT and the common word it. So you decide to use a pattern vocabulary item.



---


# Regular Vocabulary Items

The regex pattern that you can use is \bIT\b. The \b is a word boundary marker. This ensures that the pattern would not match ITSM or JIT, for example. The default case sensitivity of pattern vocabulary items means that \bIT\b would not match the common word it.

Regex details: You can turn off case sensitivity in a pattern by using (?i). You can end that mode by using a minus sign as in (?-i). For example, (?i)te(?-i)st should match both test and TEst, but not teST or TEST.

For more information, see Using regular expressions in entities.

# About this task

Regular vocabulary items provide the model with a synonym for words or phrases your users might use in an utterance. The model uses the synonym to replace the vocabulary when predicting the intent. Use a single word for the synonym when possible.

Regular vocabulary items are case-insensitive by default. If you need to create a case-sensitive vocabulary item, use a pattern vocabulary item. For more information, see Create a pattern vocabulary item.

Note: Choose a synonym that is a commonly-occurring word in the same language as your model.

In this example scenario, you are adding a vocabulary item for the word credentials. Say that your users may use credentials to refer to their password. By creating a vocabulary item, you can make sure that the system correctly predicts the intent for an utterance such as reset my credentials.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Models. The Virtual Agent tab opens by default.
2. Select the tab corresponding to your model's application, then select the name of your model.
3. On the Model details tab of the model overview, select the Vocabulary card.
4. In the Vocabulary tab, select Add a vocabulary.

# Before you begin

- Make sure that the NLU Workbench plugin, NLU Workbench - Core plugin, NLU Common Model plugin, and Predictive Intelligence plugin are all installed and activated on your instance.
- Create or use an existing NLU model for Virtual Agent or AI Search.
- Role required: nlu_editor, nlu_admin, or admin. The editor must be assigned to the model.

# About this task

Pattern vocabulary items use regular expressions (regex) to find variations of words and phrases in your users' utterances. The pattern then maps these variations to the synonym you provide. The synonym is used during intent prediction.

In this example scenario, you've created an NLU Virtual Agent model for requests related to authentication. To refer to multi-factor authentication, your users often use "MFA", "mfa", or "mfa authentication". You can provide a pattern to cover these variations. They are replaced with the matching synonym multi-factor authentication when predicting an intent.

See Using regular expressions in entities for further details on regular expressions.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Models. The Virtual Agent tab opens by default.
2. Select the tab corresponding to your model's application, then select the name of your model.
3. On the Model details tab, select the Vocabulary card.
4. Click Add a vocabulary.
5. In the Type field of the Add a vocabulary window, select Pattern.
6. Add a regular expression that covers words or phrases in your users' utterances, and a synonym the model uses to predict the intent. In this example, the regular expression covers several variations of "mfa authentication".

# Create a list vocabulary source

Create a list of words or phrases to act as a vocabulary source. The values in the list source are replaced by the synonym if they are detected in a user utterance.

# Before you begin

- Make sure that the NLU Workbench plugin, NLU Workbench - Core plugin, NLU Common Model plugin, and Predictive Intelligence plugin are all installed and activated on your instance.
- Role required: admin, nlu_admin, or nlu_editor

# About this task

Creating a list vocabulary source enables your models to interpret all the alternate and actual values of the list if they appear in a user utterance. The model interprets those values as the synonym you provide when predicting an intent.

Note: During intent prediction, the synonym you provide replaces the value. During entity prediction, the actual value is used as the entity if the actual value or one of the alternate values are detected in the utterance.

In this example procedure, you're creating a list vocabulary source for your company's meeting rooms. You add the names of the rooms and alternatives your users might call them. Once you create the list, you add it to an utterance in an intent for the model. The model interprets the intent (for example, #BookMeetingRoom) and uses the name the user entered as an entity (for example, Everest).

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Vocabulary Sources.
2. Click the My lists tab.

You must retrain the model after updating a list vocabulary source. For more information, see Train and try your NLU model.

Then you can use the list vocabulary source when annotating a training utterance. Use the @ symbol with the handle to refer to this vocabulary source.

# Create a table vocabulary source

Use the values from a ServiceNow table as a vocabulary source. Your Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models use your provided synonym to interpret utterances that contain values from the chosen source fields of the table.

# Before you begin

- Make sure that the NLU Workbench plugin, NLU Workbench - Core plugin, NLU Common Model plugin, and Predictive Intelligence plugin are all installed and activated on your instance.
- Role required: admin or nlu_admin

# About this task

Add a ServiceNow table to be used as a vocabulary source. Select one or more source fields of the table. Then, provide a synonym to be used by the model when interpreting utterances that contain values from the table. Note that the Reference field is not supported as a source field.

When you create and sync a table vocabulary source, the values from the table in your instance are extracted, and a vocabulary source is created in the NLU Service. For more information on the NLU Service, see NLU Service Updates.

Note: You should not create multiple vocabulary sources that reference the same table and fields. Create only one vocabulary source (and provide a synonym) for the particular table and fields you want to reference in the model. Otherwise, it would cause confusion in the model and interfere with prediction quality.

In this example procedure, you want your models to be able to interpret utterances with locations. The ServiceNow location (cmn_location) table already contains information regarding important locations. You set up the location table to be used as a vocabulary source.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Vocabulary Sources.
2. Click ServiceNow Tables.
3. Click Add another table.
4. On the Add another table to refer to page, configure the fields.

# b. Select the fields you want to refer to from the source table.

Note: To add multiple fields, select the plus icon.

In this example, use the following configurations:

- Field name: Select the Country (country) and City (city) fields.
- Options: Click Options, then select the Use this field to look up values check box for both of the Field name values. Checking the box makes it so either a country name or a city name can be used in an utterance for finding a record in the vocabulary source. You can also use multiple comma-separate values in this field, for example, if your city column has multiple names, such as NYC, New York, and New York City.
- Fields can appear together: Leave the check box empty. This field is typically used in an NLU Search model, where users can enter words next to each other in an utterance to find a record. For example, you can enter Pierre Development while searching for an employee named Pierre who works in the Development team, where Name and Team are two fields in the table.

# c. Configure the advanced options.

In this example, use the following configurations:

- Language: Select English - en.
- Filter by: You can use the condition builder to filter the values in the source table for the vocabulary source. Leave empty for this scenario.
- Refresh: Select Every 7 days. By selecting this, you set the system to get new values from the table every seven days. There are different refresh options you can choose based on how often the source table is updated.
- Enable Fuzzy matching: Checking this box makes it so a record can be matched even if an utterance contains a slightly misspelled word or part of a word. For example, when searching for a city such as Kansas City, you might enter Kansas City or just Kansas, and the system will still be able to match with the correct location record.

Fuzzy matching



---


may return false matches in some cases. Use fuzzy matching sparingly and test out your model before using it.

- Make case sensitive: If you don't enable fuzzy matching, you can check this box to make the values in the source table case sensitive. If an utterance doesn't use the correct cases, the model doesn't predict the intent.

# 5. Click Save.

Result: Your @Location table vocabulary source appears on the Vocabulary sources screen, where it begins to sync with its source table.

# 6. If the sync doesn't start immediately, select the Sync Lookup icon on the far right to sync the source table data with the NLU Service.

Result: When the sync completes, you can use the vocabulary source in your models. You don't need to retrain the model after updating a table vocabulary source.

# What to do next

Add a vocabulary source to a model by annotating an utterance. Use the @ symbol when adding an example utterance to an intent.

# Sync a table vocabulary source

Synchronize your table vocabulary sources to obtain the latest changes to the ServiceNow source table. Synchronizing your vocabulary sources ensures your NLU models have the latest values when predicting intents.

# Before you begin

- Make sure that the NLU Workbench plugin, NLU Workbench - Core plugin, NLU Common Model plugin, and Predictive Intelligence plugin are all installed and activated on your instance.
- Role required: admin or nlu_admin

# About this task

When you reference a vocabulary source in an utterance, it pulls the values at the time the model is trained. However, if the table values change over time, the model still references the values from the last training session.

You can select a schedule to automatically refresh the vocabulary values used by NLU. This schedule can be edited later. For more information, see Create a table vocabulary source.

# Manual Syncing of a Table Vocabulary Source

You can also manually sync a table vocabulary source, such as before model training.

Note: If an utterance references a table vocabulary source that has never been synchronized, the model fails to train. Check the vocabulary source's current status, and sync manually if Never synced.

In the following example scenario, you're manually syncing the @AccessRoles vocabulary source to the Catalog Item table.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Vocabulary Sources.
2. In the ServiceNow Tables tab, point just to the right of the Refresh column to invoke the Sync lookup icon.
3. Select Sync. The vocabulary source starts synchronization.

# What to do next

The syncing operation can take some time, depending on the source table size.

# Pre-built vocabulary

Use ServiceNow® pre-built vocabulary for software and hardware terms so the system recognizes their multiple variations in utterances.

Your Natural Language Understanding models contain pre-built vocabulary settings you can use when adding an example utterance. The vocabulary provides definitions for software and hardware terms whether they're expressed in slang or professional usage. The vocabulary can also recognize product misspellings.

For example, for one of your example utterances, you enter I need to order a Mac. When the system recognizes a pre-built vocabulary item, the term has a blue line under it.

# Utterance tab of the Intent details page

When you click the word, a window appears with two options to choose for the word:

- A pre-built suggested definition for the word
- An option to add a synonym

---



If you select the first option and click Confirm, the system uses the pre-built suggested definition and the blue line disappears.

If you select the second option, enter a synonym for the word, and click Confirm, the word and the synonym are added to the model vocabulary.

If you select either of the two options and click Ignore, the blue line disappears and the word remains as it was previously.

# Test set creation and management

Use the default test set of your NLU model to test the model's performance and accuracy. Manage your test set over time by building or updating its content in the NLU Workbench.

Embedded video: Test set management in NLU Workbench

Note: To test your model, install the ServiceNow® Store application NLU Workbench - Advanced Features. For more information, see Install NLU Workbench - Advanced Features.

When you create an NLU model for Virtual Agent or AI Search, a default test set is created and associated to the model. You can use the default test set to evaluate the model’s performance. Initially the test set is empty, ready to be populated with your content.

# Imported test utterances

Imported test utterances are assigned a source of Manual.

# Expert Feedback Loop

The Expert Feedback Loop feature lets you add actual user utterances from Virtual Agent chat logs to the test set.

These test utterances are assigned a source of Expert Feedback. For more information, see NLU Expert Feedback Loop.

# Test Coverage

The Test Coverage score is the percentage of a model's enabled intents that have test utterances in the default test set. Before testing your model, ensure that there is at least 60% coverage. The higher the Test Coverage score, the more accurate the performance testing results.

Your test coverage needs to be at least 60%, with at least 5 test utterances per intent, in order for the system to provide an optimal confidence threshold during batch testing. For more information about the confidence threshold, see NLU model settings.

Aim to have about 10 percent of a model's test utterances marked as "not relevant", meaning that there is no intent associated. This helps assess how the model handles irrelevant utterances which should not have any intent predicted. For more information about irrelevant utterances, see Irrelevance detection in NLU.

# Use the test set

To use the default test set from the Test and publish your model phase, see Test and publish your model.

To use the test set in Multi-model Batch Testing, see Multi-model Batch Testing.

# Characteristics of default test sets

When an instance is upgraded, default test sets are created for any existing models that don't already have them.

When you copy a model using Duplicate this model, the original's default test set is copied into the new model. For more information, see Duplicate an NLU model.

The utterances in the test set shouldn't be the same as the utterances in the training set.

Default test sets can't be deleted separately from their models.

Test set utterances should be in the same language as their model.

Test sets are available for Virtual Agent or AI Search models.

# Downloading or moving default test sets

Default test sets can be downloaded or moved as follows.

• Default test sets can be separately downloaded in CSV format. To download the test set, from the model's overview page navigate to Build and train your model > Test set tab. Select Download test set.

# Train and try your NLU model

Train and try your model iteratively so that its intents and entities are validated, compiled, and saved to your model.

# Before you begin

- Make sure that the NLU Workbench - Core plugin, NLU Workbench plugin, and Predictive Intelligence plugin are all installed and activated.
- Create an NLU model. For more information, see Creating models.
- Create one or more NLU intents and their associated entities for your model. For more information, see NLU intents.
- If any utterance references a table vocabulary source, ensure that the source has been synchronized so that its values are available to your model. For more information see Sync a table vocabulary source.
- Role required: nlu_editor, nlu_admin, or admin. The NLU editor must be assigned to the model.

# About this task

Training your model saves any changes you made to the content, and checks for conflicts or errors. Training also makes a model available for publishing.

After training, you can try your model by manually entering individual utterances to see what intents are predicted.

Note: To run a test of your model against a list of test utterances, see Test and publish your model.

The mid-conversation responses of Dialog Acts can't be tried or tested in NLU Workbench.

In this example scenario, you've already built sufficient model content by adding intents, utterances, entities, and their associated annotations. Following the example procedure, you first train your NLU model. Then you try your model by manually entering utterances so you can check the prediction results and confidence scores.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Models. The Virtual Agent tab opens by default.
2. Select the tab for your model's application, then select the name of your model.
3. In the Model details tab of the model overview, make sure there is enough content in Intents, Entities, and Vocabulary.
4. On the Build and train your model card on the model overview, select View phase.

# 8.

In the text field under Enter an utterance to test, type an utterance and select Go.

# Result

In this example, you entered I need to update my home address as the utterance to try.

1. The system displays the model's confidence threshold, which is 76% in this example.
2. Under Top prediction(s), the system displays all intents that were predicted with a confidence score greater than the threshold.
3. In the example, the intent UpdateAddress is predicted with a confidence score of 97%, which is greater than the threshold of 76%.

The Try model results also display thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons for you to provide feedback. For more information, see Test panel feedback.

# What to do next

- Continue trying various utterances to check that your updates to model content are effective. See Compare draft and published versions of your NLU model.
- To test your model against a list of test utterances, use its default test set in the Test and publish your model phase, or navigate to Multi-model Batch Testing.
- To adjust the model's confidence threshold, use the Settings tab on the model's overview page. For more information, see NLU model settings.
- If you're satisfied with the results of your testing, Publish your NLU model.

# Test panel feedback

When testing your NLU model on the Try model section of the test panel, use this feature to provide feedback on the model's intent predictions.

# Summary context

When a model is trained and tested for an utterance and the model returns an intent prediction, you can provide a thumbs up or thumbs down rating on the predicted intent it returns. Marking a different intent prediction as correct adds the utterance to the corrected intent. All other feedback is captured for continual learning. The system then incorporates your feedback to optimize the model predictions. This feature requires the nlu_admin role to access and test the model. NLU editors can also access the test panel if an NLU admin assigns them to it.

# Providing prediction feedback

The ratings you provide help the system to match an intent to an utterance. These ratings are essential for the system to continuously learn, evolve, and improve the accuracy of the intent predictions based on user input. They also enable you to notify the system if the intent prediction is correct or not.

The following scenarios below show examples of how to interact with your model test panel and provide prediction feedback to the system. In all scenarios, you use these four steps:

1. In the Build and train your model phase of your model, select Try model to open the test panel.
2. In the test panel's Enter an utterance to test field, enter a brief utterance that's similar to a training utterance in one of the intents.
3. Click GO.

Result: The system returns its predictions for your test utterance in the Top Predictions(s) section of the test panel.

Click the Thumbs Up icon or the Thumbs Down icon.

If you want the system to know it has predicted the correct intent for your utterance, select the Thumbs Up icon.

In all other cases, select the Thumbs Down icon, which opens the Provide feedback to improve this prediction section. Here you can choose an intent other than the top predicted intent.

# Scenario 1:

On the Try model section of the test panel, you enter help with hr as the utterance. When the top prediction results appear, you're confident that the predicted intent is the correct match to your utterance. So in this case, you click the Thumbs Up icon.

# Results:

- The system predicted the correct intent, which in this case is #CreateHRGeneralInquiryCase.
- Your feedback notifies the system that it has matched the correct intent to your test utterance.

# Scenario 2

In a separate model on a separate instance, a different user enters the same help with hr utterance. The system responds with the top prediction results for the intent, but the user isn't sure if it's the correct intent or not. So this user clicks the Thumbs Down icon, as shown in the image below.

If users click the Its correct intent should be: button, a list appears where they can choose a more appropriate intent for the test utterance. In this example scenario, a user selects the Retrieve Work Location intent, as shown in the image below.

If you click the I'm not sure what the correct intent is prompt, instead of returning a top prediction, the system shows the next best intent predictions available.

# Scenario 3:

In a separate model on a separate instance, another user submits an utterance that uses gibberish, or uses a language that's different from the language the model uses. For example, a user mistakenly submits an utterance comprised of both non-English and English languages, as shown in the image below.

So instead of choosing an intent from the prompt, this user selects the No intent should be predicted option.

Note: When you choose and save No intent should be predicted, the utterance is removed from all intents which it is a part of.

# Scenario 4:

Along with choosing from a list of your model's intents for a prediction, you can also directly notify the system that the utterance is irrelevant to the model. To do this, you click the Exclude this model's predictions for this utterance button, then click Save changes.

# What to do next

Use the information in the test panel to see if the changes you make will improve the model's performance. Once you are satisfied with your changes, test your model before publishing. Then, publish your model to replace the current published version.

# Irrelevance detection in NLU

Keep Virtual Agent chats focused with Irrelevance detection. Use the Irrelevance detection feature to train your NLU model to avoid making predictions for utterances that are not relevant.

# Summary information

The Irrelevance detection feature improves the prediction accuracy of NLU models by training them to ignore certain utterances. These utterances from your users may not apply to any intent, so should not get any prediction.

To ensure that models do not predict an intent when they are not supposed to, you can mark utterances as Not relevant. These marked utterances are included as part of model training. When the published model encounters similar utterances from your users, no intent is matched or predicted.

The Irrelevance detection table is where you can manage utterances marked as Not relevant.

# Roles, Usage, and Navigation

Use the nlu_admin or admin role to access Irrelevance Detection. The nlu_editor role is also able to access Irrelevance Detection, but must be assigned to a model to edit that model's contents.

Irrelevance Detection is available for Virtual Agent models only.

1. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Models. The Virtual Agent tab opens by default.
2. Scroll down the list of Virtual Agent models to the Boost your model performance section.
3. Scroll horizontally to locate the card Keep chats focused, and select its button Go to irrelevance detection.

Note: The instance URL for this feature is <instance-name>.servicenow.com/now/nlu-workbench/irrelevant-utterances.</instance-name>

# Adding utterances to Irrelevance detection

There are several methods for adding utterances to Irrelevance detection:

- The Virtual Agent chat log: In the Expert Feedback Loop in NLU Workbench, when you review an utterance collected from the Virtual Agent chat log, you can mark it as Not relevant. The system will ask whether it should be irrelevant to a particular model, or to all models. After adding, these utterances may display as NO_INTENT in Expert Feedback Loop.
- For more information on Expert Feedback Loop in NLU, see NLU Expert Feedback Loop.

These utterances have a Source of VA Chat Logs in the Irrelevance detection table.

Manual input: In Irrelevance detection, type your utterance in the Type utterances here field, then select Add. The system will ask whether it should be irrelevant to a particular model, or to all models.

---


# Irrelevance Detection

These utterances have a Source of Manual in the Irrelevance detection table.

• Importing: When you use a CSV or XLSX (Excel Workbook) file to import training utterances and their intents, you can indicate irrelevant utterances by leaving the Intent column empty. These utterances may display as NO_INTENT in areas such as Expert Feedback Loop and Conflict Review.

For more information on importing utterances and intents, see Create an NLU model from a CSV file.

These utterances have a Source of Manual in the Irrelevance detection table.

# Behavior of Irrelevant Utterances

There are two types of irrelevant utterances: those associated to one specific model, or those irrelevant to any model. A model can have a maximum of 200 irrelevant utterances associated to it.

Following are details of how these two types and the 200-count maximum interact.

When a model is submitted for training, at most 200 irrelevant utterances are submitted with it. First, irrelevant utterances directly associated to that model are submitted. Then, utterances which are designated as not relevant to any model are submitted. The total of these types does not exceed 200.

If a model has 200 irrelevant utterances associated to it, and a new irrelevant utterance is added, then the model's oldest utterance is dropped. The new irrelevant utterance could be of either type (not relevant to the specific model, or not relevant to any model).

A model cannot have more irrelevant utterances than normal training utterances.

# Conflict Review

If an utterance is marked as irrelevant, and there is a similar utterance in an intent, the model does not make a prediction for that utterance. In other words, irrelevant utterances take precedence over training utterances.

Because irrelevant utterances impact the model's predictions, they are displayed as conflicts when they overlap with training utterances.

There are two locations where conflicts with irrelevant utterances are highlighted:

- The Cross-model Conflict Review module. For more information about this module, see Cross-model Conflict Review.

Note: The Cross-model Conflict Review module is available with the NLU Workbench - Advanced Features application from ServiceNow® Store. For more information, see NLU Workbench - Advanced Features.

- The Conflicts tab of an intent. For more information on conflicts in an intent, see Resolve intent issues.

For the purpose of reviewing conflicts, irrelevant utterances are displayed as though they are in their own intent, named NO_INTENT.

Note that irrelevant utterances cannot be edited or deleted on the conflict page. Copy the irrelevant utterance from the conflict page to the Irrelevance detection page to modify or delete the utterance.

# More information

- In test sets, aim to include about 10% of test utterances as irrelevant. This helps to assess how your model handles utterances that should not have an intent predicted. When you import training or test utterances from a CSV or XLSX (Excel Workbook) file, you can indicate that an utterance is irrelevant by leaving the Intent column empty.
- When testing models against test sets, results are considered Correct if no intent is predicted for an irrelevant utterance.
- Utterances that were marked as Not relevant can be re-assigned later. For example, if a new intent is created, existing irrelevant utterances can be manually assigned to the new intent. They then become part of the normal training utterances.

To re-assign an utterance in Irrelevance detection, expand the list in the Corrected intent column and select the appropriate intent. Be sure to select the Save feedback button after re-assignment. Also be sure to retrain the model to incorporate these updates into the model.

- Irrelevant utterances are not associated to particular intents within a model. They are either associated to one model, or marked as not relevant to any model.
- The utterances which are marked as not relevant to any model are submitted as part of the training data for each model. In other words, these apply to all models.
- Model training is necessary to incorporate Not relevant utterances. Training any model adds newly marked utterances to all models.
- Utterances can be deleted or edited in the Irrelevance detection table.
- Irrelevant utterances should have content that is different from utterances associated to an intent.

# Tune your model

On your model's overview in NLU Workbench, open the Tune your model phase to review and incorporate user utterances from the Expert Feedback Loop.

# Summary usage

The Tune your model phase on your model's overview takes you to the NLU Expert Feedback Loop feature, which collects data from Virtual Agent chat logs and provides it to you for feedback.

Note: The ServiceNow® Store application NLU Workbench - Advanced Features must be installed to view Tune your model. The Virtual Agent plugin is also required.

When the Expert Feedback Loop has feedback waiting for your review, You have utterances that need feedback is highlighted on the card.

Change your NLU model's name, description, or confidence threshold on the Settings page of the model overview.

Access the model's settings by navigating to All > NLU Workbench > Models. Select the tab for your model's application, then your model's name. On the model's overview, select the Model settings tab.

# Model settings

In the upper section of the model settings page, you can change the model's name, short description, and business area. You cannot change the model's language, purpose, or scope. To make a model with a different language, purpose, or scope, see Creating models.

By default, the Ignore punctuation check box is active. Ignoring punctuation makes it so that there is less variance between predicted intents and confidence scores for utterances with slightly different punctuation. For best results, keep the check box active.

# Model threshold settings

Here you can adjust how the confidence threshold works in your model.

A threshold is a confidence score represented by a percentage. The confidence threshold of a model determines what intents from that model will be predicted for a given utterance. For example, if the model threshold is 65%, then an intent will be predicted for an utterance only when the intent has a confidence score that is at least 65%. Setting a threshold that is

# Model Threshold Settings

Too low may increase the false positives by predicting intents that should not be a match for an utterance. On the other hand, a model threshold that is too high may filter out intents that you do want to get predicted. Finding the ideal threshold improves your model's ability to predict intents correctly.

# Types of Model Threshold Settings

- Automatic - Allow the system to choose the optimal confidence threshold for your model. The value is updated dynamically based on test results. This happens in the Test and publish your model phase, where your model's default test set is used.
- Manual - You can manually set the confidence threshold. The system may also recommend a better threshold for the model during testing. You can choose to accept recommendations.

Prebuilt models come with a tuned threshold. The confidence threshold on prebuilt models was chosen specifically for that model.

# Test Results and Recommendations

Test results include a model threshold recommendation only if they meet the following requirements:

- The test set has a Test Coverage score of at least 60%, with at least 5 test utterances per intent. For more information, see Test set creation and management.
- The test set has at least 100 utterances.
- The model is not a prebuilt model.
- The recommended threshold would have better results than the current threshold.

Test results with a recommended threshold contain a second graphic. The second graphic shows the prediction percentages with the recommended thresholds applied.

Applying the threshold recommendation may improve the prediction percentages of your model. Select Apply recommendations to change the threshold. The system automatically retrains the model, and the test results show the prediction percentages with the new threshold.

# Multilingual Model Management

Use multilingual Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models for the system to understand user input in several languages. The NLU Workbench helps you manage and maintain a consistent structure for content across languages to provide a unified experience.

# Primary and secondary languages

A primary language is the source language you choose when creating a model. These models are considered primary models. Primary models can then be translated into different languages. Those translated models are referred to as secondary models. The languages in which they are translated are referred to as secondary languages.

The NLU Workbench home displays primary and secondary language models nested under the model name. Select the arrow to the left of the model name to expand the language group.

# Multilingual model management

Multilingual model management provides a way for you to group, oversee, and update your NLU models. The designation for the model language works as follows:

- Primary models have a language you assign to them during model creation and listed as English (Primary). The language of the primary model is the source language for the translations that follow later in the secondary models.
- Secondary models are translated copies of the primary model. Each secondary model uses a different language, such as Brazilian Portuguese, Polish, or Finnish.
- Any supported language can be the primary language for a primary model or the secondary language for a secondary model.
- Within a model group, you can't have two secondary models that use the same language.

For more information on the languages available in NLU, see NLU language support.

# Implementing language grouping

Grouping languages is optional but helps with organizing various language versions of models. There are two methods for ensuring that model languages are grouped:

- You can add a language to a primary model in the model's More options menu, which automatically creates a secondary language model with translation options. For more information on adding and translating a language, see Translate a multilingual model.
- You can access the instance model migration page directly by visiting &#x3C;instance_name>.service-now.com/$nlu-studio.do#/model-migration. For more information on language grouping using this method, see Model language grouping.

# Primary and secondary model interactions

To ensure consistency within a model group, the names of intents and entities in all secondary models are the same as the content in the primary model. New intents can only be created in a primary model. Creating an intent in a primary model adds the intent to all the secondary models within the model group, but without any utterances in them.

# Interaction between primary models, secondary models, and content

When you add an intent to a primary model, the intent is added to all of its secondary models. Every intent in a secondary model is mapped to its corresponding intent in the primary model. The mapping of intents ensures that any application that uses these intents can access all the secondary intents through their corresponding primary intents.

When you delete an intent or entity in a primary model, its corresponding intents and entities are also deleted in its secondary models. Therefore, the secondary models must always follow the status of the primary model content. Although you can't delete intents in secondary models, you can disable them.

For more information on intent interactions, see Import primary model content to a secondary model.

You can't delete an entity created in a secondary model if it's a copy of a corresponding entity created in the primary model. However, you can add or delete an entity in a secondary model if it doesn't have a corresponding entity in the primary model.

Whenever you translate a model or add intents and entities to secondary models, the model must be reviewed. Secondary models marked with Needs review must be manually reviewed before publishing.

# Viewing secondary models that need reviewing

If every intent in a secondary model is disabled, then the Train and Try buttons are also disabled in the model. However, even if only one intent is enabled in the model, then you can train and test the model. Ensure that some intents are enabled in your secondary models to translate them.

Note: When training and testing, prediction scores for similar utterances across primary and secondary models can be different. The context comes across differently among languages due to inherent structural variations.

# Duplicating grouped models and model groups

Using the nlu_admin role, you can duplicate primary models, secondary models, and entire model groups. You can duplicate just the primary model or a set of secondary models from among the model group.

Following is a list of system behaviors you may encounter when you duplicate these models.

- If you duplicate a secondary model that's in a model group, the duplicated version becomes a separate primary model that is outside that model group.
- All intents are duplicated. The duplicated intent maintains the same Enabled status as the original intent.
- When duplicating a primary model, you can duplicate a set of secondary models, or all of the secondary models along with it. This action creates a model group comprised of duplicated versions with the respective original models marked as the source models.
- When duplicating a model group, you can choose an existing secondary model to be the primary model for the duplicated group.
- If you select a secondary model in an existing model group as a new primary model while duplicating the group, all the disabled entities are enabled for the duplicated version of the secondary model. The secondary model becomes the primary model in the new duplicated model group.
- If you duplicate a primary model without any secondary model, the duplicated version becomes a separate primary model.

For more information, see Duplicate an NLU model.

# Model language grouping

Language grouping makes it easier to manage your multilingual Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models. You can review existing language groups and designate new language groups.

# Language grouping

Language grouping organizes your NLU models into primary and secondary models, and indicates the primary language and primary model for the group.

If you have added a new language to a model, a language group is created automatically, so you may already have existing language groups. For more information on adding and translating a new language model, see Translate a multilingual model.

# Reviewing your grouped models

To view current language groups and inspect possible new language groups, navigate to:

&#x3C;instance_name>.service-now.com/$nlu-studio.do#/model-migration.

The page titled Review how we've grouped your models opens.

There are two things you can do on the Review how we've grouped your model screen when using the nlu_admin role.

- You can review and edit current model language groups in the upper section. For existing language groups, any intent and entity mappings from Virtual Agent (VA) are displayed. To update VA mappings or to make one of the secondary languages the primary language in the group, select the Edit button. The page titled Review what's in this grouping opens. When you complete your edits, select the Save button.

# Translate a multilingual model

Add a language to an existing NLU model by translating it. Use one of several translation options to add a secondary model in a supported language.

# Before you begin

- Activate the Localization Framework (com.glide.localization_framework.installer) plugin. See Localization Framework.
- In your target application scope, create a primary language model, or use an existing primary model.
- Multilingualism is available for Virtual Agent and AI Search models.
- Role required: nlu_admin or admin.

Note: The nlu_editor role cannot initiate a model translation, because the nlu_editor does not have permission to create a new model. See Assign an NLU editor to a model.

# About this task

Translating a model creates a secondary model of the language you choose, in the same application scope as the primary model.

The secondary model contains the same content as the primary. However, the intents of the secondary model are disabled and must be reviewed prior to publishing the secondary model.

To translate a primary model and create a secondary model, you must choose a translation mode. The modes appear in the user interface as individual cards that you use in Step 4 of.



---


This procedure. Activated cards appear surrounded by a thin green border. Only activated cards can be selected as your translation mode. For the Use AI and Use a third party modes, selecting the Add button on an activated card starts the translation.

The No translation mode is active by default and available for all languages. However, the Use AI and Use a third party modes are activated only when the localization framework (LF) settings for the secondary language are in place.

Note: Before you add a new model in a secondary language, you must ensure that the Localization Framework (LF) settings for the secondary language are completed.

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Translation mode</td>
<td>Description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Use AI</td>
<td>Translate using machine-intelligence providers such as Google. Selecting the card creates a translated secondary model. Machine translations may be incorrect or too literal, so review the translated content for accuracy. For more information, see Dynamic Translation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>Use a third party</td>
<td>Request translation by a professional translation team. When you select this mode, an LF task is created per the LF language group settings for the secondary language. When the translations are completed, the translated model is created and ready for review. For more information, see Localization Framework and Translation modes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No translation</td>
<td>Default. Manually translate your primary language into a secondary language. Selecting this mode creates a draft secondary model with the intent names the same as that of the primary model. These intents are disabled by default, and you must enter your utterances manually. Names of intents and names of entities imported from the primary model aren't editable. Names of entities that you create directly in the secondary model are editable. This mode is also helpful if you want to draft and save the primary model first, and then translate your utterances later.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

Multilingual models are supported in 17 languages.

Note: Some of these languages support only intents, not entities. If the language is intent-only, your primary model entities will not be translated or copied. For more information, see NLU language support.

In this example scenario, your primary model uses the English language and you're adding a version in the French language, without translating utterances.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Models. The Virtual Agent tab opens by default. If appropriate, select the AI Search tab.
2. Identify a primary model to which you want to assign a secondary language.
3. In the row of the primary model, select the more options menu, then select Add a language.

# What to do next

If you chose to enable the model without translation, you must manually enter training utterances for each intent. If you choose to use software or a third-party translator, you must review the translations before you can continue working on the model.

Entering training utterances and reviewing secondary models can be delegated to users who have the nlu_editor role. For more information, see Assign an NLU editor to a model and Resolve intent issues.

# Enable or disable a secondary model intent

Enable and disable intents in your Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models to make them active or inactive. Disable intents while editors or admins edit, review, or update its content and translations.

# Before you begin

Role required: nlu_admin or nlu_editor

# About this task

NLU admins and NLU editors can enable or disable intents in secondary models. If an intent is disabled, the model doesn't use it to make predictions. However, it also can't be accessed by any ServiceNow application using the model, such as Virtual Agent or Search.

An intent's state is represented in the Enabled column.

# Intents list

Enabling of intents works in the following ways:

- Intents created in primary models are active by default.
- Intents from primary models are automatically created, but not enabled, in their secondary models (pending import).
- Disabling an intent in the primary model disables the corresponding intent in all secondary models.
- If an intent is disabled in the primary model, the intent can't be re-enabled in a secondary model.
- Enabling a disabled intent in the primary model does not enable the corresponding intents in the secondary models.
- Disabling intents in secondary models has no effect on the primary model or other secondary models.
- Secondary model intents that are marked with Needs review are disabled by default.
- If you disable a primary model intent that is mapped to a Virtual Agent (VA) topic, a confirmation message appears.
- If you disable a secondary model intent that is mapped to a VA topic, a confirmation message appears.
- NLU admins can enable and disable intents in any model.
- NLU editors can enable and disable intents only for models they are assigned to.



---


# Disabling Intents

Disabling intents gives editors time to review the intent translations and update them if needed. When you’re satisfied with the content, enable the intent to make it accessible to other NLU models and ServiceNow applications.

# Review Example

In this review example, you have a list of disabled intents in the Needs review state. The goal of this task is to review the translated content for a secondary model. When you complete your review, or if the content is fine as it is, you click Mark as reviewed. This moves the intent into the Reviewed state. You can also undo the Mark as reviewed state for an intent by clicking the Unmark Reviewed button, but only if you remain on the Intent screen. If you leave the screen prematurely, the Unmark Reviewed button disappears, and you won't be able to retrieve it.

# Switching States

Switch between the Reviewed and Unmark Reviewed states for an intent.

# Editorial Review

The editorial review also includes the Vocabulary section on the Model screen, where vocabulary that has been translated from the primary model to the secondary model is marked with an orange dot and the Needs review state. You can edit or delete the vocabulary items, even if they are in review. After you review the vocabulary and update the translations if needed, you can mark all of them at once by clicking the Mark all reviewed button. This action makes the orange dot disappear from the Vocabulary section of the Model screen.

Note: The Train and Try buttons on the Model screen are disabled until the vocabulary is reviewed, and the intents in the Needs review state are either reviewed or disabled.

# Items that Require Review

In this example scenario, you have applied the Use Software translation mode to translate a secondary model into the Japanese language. Because the translation hasn't been reviewed yet, the system marks the intents and the model with the Needs review state. When a model is in the Needs review state, it can't be trained, tested, or published. When it moves out of the Needs review state, you can then train and test the model.

Note: An NLU editor can't create or publish a model. Only the NLU admin has permission to do this.

# Example Procedure

In this example procedure, you're reviewing the intents in a model one at a time.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Models.
2. Locate one of your secondary models that has already been translated.

In this example scenario, you locate the Virtual Agent Conversation Setup JA model, as shown in the image below.

In the Intents section of the model, there's a list of five intents that are marked with the Needs review state. Above the list of intents, there's also a box that shows a running count of the intents that need review.

# The needs review state

Click an intent Name so you can access the intent content. In this scenario, you click the #End Conversations intent name.
Review the secondary language translations of the model utterances, entities, and vocabulary, then update the content as needed. When you finish your review of the intent, the Mark as reviewed button appears.
Click Mark as reviewed. Result: The system updates the #End Conversations intent from the Mark as reviewed state to the Reviewed state. In addition, the reviewed intents box changes its running count from 0 of 5 to 1 of 5.
If you're satisfied with your intent review, click the Enable button so the intent is available and can be accessed by any application, such as Virtual Agent (VA) or Search.

# What to do next

Repeat Steps 1 through 6 for the four remaining intents in the list. As each intent review completes and is marked with the Reviewed state, the running count in the intents reviewed box increases toward 5 of 5.

# Assign an NLU editor to a model

Assign an editor to review your Natural Language Understanding (NLU) model translations and edit model content. Delegate the maintenance, testing, and optimization of model content to an editor.

# Before you begin

- Create a model, or use an existing one. For translation review, create both primary and secondary (translated) models. For more information on multilingual model groups, see Multilingual model management.
- Assign the nlu_editor role to users. See Assign a role to a user.
- Role required: nlu_admin. The nlu_editor can't assign another editor to models.

# About this task

The nlu_admin can delegate model content work to an nlu_editor. Assign language specialists as editors to review the consistency between primary and secondary (translated) models, or further localize the translation by editing intents and utterances. Delegate the maintenance of an existing model's content, without affecting the model's published status.

The nlu_editor can do the following, when assigned to a model:

- Train and test the model.
- Export an NLU model as CSV.
- When a model or intent is in the Needs review state, the editor can mark it as Reviewed.
- Modify the model's confidence threshold.
- Edit the model name and description in Settings.
- Review, edit, and approve translated utterances.
- Add, edit, and delete training utterances.
- Annotate training utterances (add references to NLU vocabulary and NLU entities).
- Update entity properties (except the entity name in a secondary model).
- Add, edit, or delete the model's vocabulary.
- View the Vocabulary sources module (read only).
- Add, activate, and de-activate NLU intents in primary and secondary models.
- Resolve conflicting intents; also access the Cross-model Conflict Review module.
- View the Irrelevance detection in NLU module.
- Add, edit, or delete a test utterance in a test set; also access the Multi-model Batch Testing module.

Note: The editor must be assigned to a model and in the model's application scope to take these actions, unless otherwise indicated.

The nlu_editor can't do the following:

- Create, add, publish, or delete a model.
- Duplicate a model.
- Translate a model (initiate a translated secondary model).
- Import primary model content to a secondary (translated) model.
- Sync or edit vocabulary sources.
- View model performance.
- Provide feedback in NLU Expert Feedback Loop.
- Manage other editors, such as assigning an editor to a model or removing an editor from a model.

# Assigning an NLU Editor to a Model

First, an admin assigns the nlu_editor role to a user. Next, the NLU admin assigns the editor to a model.

When you assign an editor to a model, you must do so at the individual model level. You can't assign an editor at the model group level.

The following models can't be assigned to an editor:

- Prebuilt models
- Models that have a translation in progress

In this example procedure, you add an NLU editor to a secondary model that needs reviewing.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Models. The Virtual Agent tab opens by default. Select the appropriate tab for your model.
2. Locate the name of your NLU model and scroll to the right end of its row. If your model is in a multilingual group, expand the group to find the individual model. Editors cannot be assigned to groups.
3. Select the model's More options menu, then select Manage editors in the list.

# Import primary model content to a secondary model

When content in your primary NLU model is updated, you can import the updates directly to secondary models.

# Before you begin

- Activate the Localization Framework (com.glide.localization_framework.installer) plugin. See Localization Framework.
- For Virtual Agent or AI Search models, create or use an existing primary model that has at least one secondary model.
- Role required: nlu_admin or admin.

# About this task

You can import content from a primary model to a secondary model after the initial translation. If you modify the primary model, those changes can be imported to your secondary models without the need to translate the entire primary model once again.

You can import primary model content to only one secondary model at a time.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Models. The Virtual Agent tab opens by default. Select the appropriate tab for your model.
2. Access a secondary model that has been translated under the primary model, and on Build and train your model, select View phase. By default you are taken to the Intents tab.
3. Select the Check primary model for new content button.

The banner Import and translate the content to keep this model updated appears at the top of the screen, along with a summary of the updates in the primary model.

# Integration setup tasks, roles, and details

As Virtual Agent administrators create and configure their conversation topics, they must first create their NLU model and its associated intents in the NLU Workbench. This action requires they use the NLU Workbench and the admin or nlu_admin role.

In addition, they must also complete the following tasks in Virtual Agent General Settings.

- Enable NLU.
- Select the NLU service provider.
- If using language-specific NLU models, enable the languages for those models.

Virtual Agent administrators must also apply their NLU model to a conversation topic by completing the following tasks in Virtual Agent Designer:

- In Topic Properties, select the NLU model, the NLU intent, and the topic switching behavior.
- For input controls used in the topic flow, set the NLU properties for entity extraction.

Optionally, admins can activate Dialog Acts to enable Virtual Agent to respond flexibly when users make a modification in mid-conversation. Currently available response types are Modify, Affirm, and Negate, based on the last 5 exchanges in the conversation. Dialog Acts can be configured for English only, in Topic Properties. For more information see Dialog Acts for Virtual Agent.

After the NLU model is complete and associated with a Virtual Agent conversation topic, administrators with the virtual_agent_admin or admin role can do the following from within the Virtual Agent Designer user interface:

- Update NLU intent utterances.
- Train, test, and publish the NLU model.

# Publishing topics from Virtual Agent

When your model is published in the NLU Workbench, it's ready to use in Virtual Agent Designer. When editing a topic, click the Properties tab to select a model and intent to map to that topic.

When you click Publish, the model and intent are mapped to that topic and published seamlessly.

# Publishing a topic with a mapped intent fails for the following reasons:

- Model isn't trained, or training is in progress.
- The last trained model is already published with a VA topic.
- The intent is not enabled in the model.

# NLU Workbench - Advanced Features

NLU Workbench - Advanced Features expands the functionality of NLU Workbench to help you manage and improve your models.

# Summary usage

# Installation

Multi-model Batch Testing is part of the NLU Workbench - Advanced Features app available on the ServiceNow® Store.

To use Multi-model Batch Testing, ensure that the NLU Workbench - Advanced Features (com.snc.nlu.workbench.advanced) plugin is active on your instance. For more information, see Install NLU Workbench - Advanced Features and Activate the NLU Workbench.

# Test sets

Test sets are lists of utterances and matched intents. Create a test set by using a table in a CSV or XLSX (Excel workbook) file. The table should contain two columns: one for utterances, and one for the expected intent. Your test set can include up to 10,000 rows.

To get the most out of testing your NLU models, your test sets should include utterances that the model is likely to encounter from your users. Test utterances should be in the same language as the model to be tested. The test set should also include utterances with no expected intents. Including utterances with no expected intent helps assess your model's ability to detect utterances which are irrelevant and shouldn't have any intent predicted.

By including these types of utterances, the test better assesses the model's ability to perceive intents and respond to your users. If your test set does not cover at least 60% of the intents of the models, you can still run the test but the recommended threshold may not be optimal.

Note: Certain test utterances are skipped during the test if their expected intent does not match any intents in the models.

To create a test set, see Create a test set.

After you have a test set, you can test trained NLU models. To begin testing, see Run a multi-model batch test.

After running a test, your results appear on the Test results page.

# Test results

The Test results page lists your completed and in-progress tests. At a glance, the results page shows the models tested against, the number of utterances, and prediction percentages.

To see the details of a test result, click the name of the test set.

The Overview page shows summary information about the results and includes a graphic with a breakdown of predictions.



---


# The Intents that need attention (Current model)

shows the top 5 missed and incorrect intents. Click the intent name to drill down into the test utterances that were predicted incorrectly. Use this information to improve the model.

# Detailed results

The Detailed results tab lists information about each utterance that was tested. From here, you can see the prediction outcome and confidence per model for each utterance. Filter the results by using the search bar or interacting with the filter tools and column headers.

You can also export the test results to a CSV file by clicking Export. The file includes the same columns as the detailed results page.

For more information on understanding your test results, see Test and publish your model.

# Create a test set

To create or add to an NLU test set, you can upload a file of test utterances matched with correct intents. Use the test set to assess the performance of your model.

# Before you begin

- Ensure that the NLU Workbench - Core plugin, NLU Workbench plugin, NLU Workbench - Advanced Features plugin and Predictive Intelligence plugin are all installed and activated
- You can use test sets with NLU models for Virtual Agent and AI Search.
- Role required: nlu_editor, nlu_admin, or admin. The editor must be assigned to the model.

# About this task

Your CSV or XLSX (Excel Workbook) file should contain a table that pairs your test utterances with the intents that you expect for them. Your file can contain up to 10,000 utterances. Ensure that the file has columns titled "Utterance" and "Expected intent".

Note: For test sets in languages other than English, you must add the glide.import.csv.charset system property with the value UTF-8. See Import sets properties.

For the most accurate test results, include utterances that the model is likely to encounter from your users. Ensure that you have test utterances covering all the intents in your model.

Aim to include about 10% of test utterances with no expected intents. Including utterances with no expected intent helps assess your model's ability to detect irrelevant utterances that should not have any intent predicted.

Note: To indicate that a test utterance in your file has no expected intent, the value for "Expected intent" should be empty.

# Example test set table

# About this task

In Multi-model Batch Testing, you can use a test set that is not the model's default test set.

Also, you can test up to ten models at one time using Multi-model Batch Testing. However, tests with fewer models run more quickly.

When testing multiple models, your test set must cover at least 25% of the total intents of all the models. Use test sets that contain utterances the models are likely to encounter in Virtual Agent or AI Search.

Note: If an expected intent in your test set doesn't match any intent in your models, that expected intent and its test utterances are skipped. They aren't counted or displayed in test results.

To test a single model against its default test set, use the Test and publish your model phase on the model's overview page. For more information, see Test and publish your model.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > NLU Advanced Features > Multi-model Batch Testing.
2. Click Run a test.
3. In the Run new batch test window, select your models from the list.
4. Select a test set from the list.
5. Click Run.

Your new test shows in the Test results list with a Testing... Status.

# What to do next

When the batch test is finished, its Status changes to Done. You can click the name of the test set to view the test results.

# Cross-model Conflict Review

Identify conflicting intents within or across models so you can take corrective actions, resolve such conflicts, and improve your NLU model performance.

# Summary usage

As the number of intents within a model increases, two intents may overlap in scope. This may occur when training utterances in one intent are almost identical to utterances in another intent. There may also be conflicting intents across models and even applications.

Utterances may also be marked as Not relevant, meaning that no intent should be predicted. When these irrelevant utterances are too similar to utterances assigned to an intent, they are displayed in Conflict Review. For more information, see Irrelevance detection in NLU.

To address and fix these issues, Cross-model Conflict Review runs an analysis on your models. Use the analysis to identify and resolve these issues prior to model publication and deployment.

# Installation

Cross-model Conflict Review is part of the NLU Workbench - Advanced Features app available on the ServiceNow® Store.

To use Cross-model Conflict Review, ensure that the NLU Workbench - Advanced Features (com.snc.nlu.workbench.advanced) plugin is active on your instance. For more information, see Install NLU Workbench - Advanced Features and Activate the NLU Workbench.

# Roles

To access Cross-model Conflict Review, use the nlu_admin or admin role. When assigned to a model, the nlu_editor can resolve conflicts in that model.

# Running the analysis

The Conflict Review screen shows a list view of all conflict reviews created in your instance. When a review is completed, it's added to a running list of reviews. In this example scenario, you're creating the first review in your instance, so when it's completed, it's shown in the count as 1 of 1 reviews. As more conflicts arise over time, you will see multiple reviews in the list.

Conflict reviews are analyzed on either one or two NLU models. When you run an analysis on a single model, the system shows intents and utterances that are only in that model. When you run an analysis on 2 models, the system shows intents and utterances that are in both models.

Conflict reviews always run on the last trained version of the model(s) they analyze.

Conflict reviews have two types: Critical and Moderate. The standard approach is to begin with the critical ones.

When a conflict is detected, you can use one of following actions to resolve the conflict:

---


• Ignore the conflict

• Delete an identical or nearly identical utterance from one of the intents

• Edit the utterances to make them more distinct from each other

In this example scenario, you're resolving a conflict where two different intents contain the exact same utterance.

1. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > NLU Advanced Features > Cross-model Conflict Review.
2. Select Run analysis.
3. In the Model(s) field on the Choose one or two models to analyze for conflicts screen, select two NLU models for the analysis. In this example scenario, you choose the demo_hardware_issue and demo_it_request models.
4. Select Run Analysis.

Running conflict analysis

The Conflict Review screen refreshes to show the analysis, including the two models you selected for analysis, the counts of Critical and Moderate conflicts under review, the number of reviews that have been completed, and the run date for the analysis. If you point to the far right column on the screen you will see options to rerun the analysis, or delete it and start all over.

In the Model(s) column, select your two paired models so you can drill down into the review.

Conflict review

The screen refreshes to show the details of the conflict review. Note the summary of the two models you chose for the analysis, their latest training dates, the types of conflicts they hold, and the version time stamp of the analysis. Note also the 0 of 1 count, which indicates that this is the first conflict review created in this instance. As the system detects more conflicts over time, and those conflicts are reviewed, the count increases.

# Reviewing Conflict Details

If you were to determine the utterances in the image below are fine as they are, then you should click Ignore. Clicking Ignore tells the system you've completed your review, so it marks it as reviewed and moves on to the next conflict review. However, in this scenario, you don't ignore the conflict, because intents that share the same utterance are a conflict worthy of review.

# To determine how you will resolve this conflict, consider the 2 intent names and the identical utterances they share.

Consider which intent is more likely to use the laptop is really slow utterance. If you compare the 2 intent names closely, you might realize that a laptop that's really slow isn't the same as a laptop that doesn't work. However, a laptop that's really slow is indeed a laptop issue. So in this example scenario, you decide to dig deeper into the intents to scan the context of their other utterances.

Note also that when an intent uses unique utterances, it helps the system to more accurately predict which utterances belong to it. Hence, you will need to edit or delete the utterance from 1 of the 2 intents. In this example scenario, you decide to dig into the #laptop_not_working intent.

# 6. Select laptop_not_working.

# Result:

The Conflict Review list screen appears, showing your conflict review analysis is complete, and that it's been reviewed.

# Confirmation that a conflict has been reviewed

# NLU Model Performance

Use NLU Model Performance to see how well your models predicted intents in Virtual Agent (VA) based on end-user confirmation.

# Summary usage

The NLU Model Performance application provides an analysis and report of how well your NLU models predict VA users' intents from their utterances. As NLU models for VA are updated, published, and deployed, you can use NLU Model Performance to review the efficacy of the intent predictions they make. If these predictions are skipped, it’s because they're unable to predict an intent with a high enough confidence score for the model. To improve VA topic prediction, the system groups unsupported VA utterances into clusters for an analysis and then generates a report that identifies the outcome of the analysis.

To access this application, use the nlu_admin or admin role and navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Performance.

Note: To use NLU Model Performance, you must first have at least 5,000 VA utterances in your instance. With the nlu_admin role, you can modify this limit by resetting the sn_nlu_workbench.glide.nlu.performance.min_clustering_records property.

# Installation

NLU Model Performance is an application available on the ServiceNow® Store. To use this application, ensure that the NLU Workbench - Advanced Features (sn_nlu_workbench) plugin is active on your instance. For more information, see Install NLU Workbench - Advanced Features and Activate the NLU Workbench. Because NLU Model Performance relies on data coming in from VA, ensure that the Glide Virtual Agent (com.glide.cs.chatbot) plugin is also active. See Activate Virtual Agent.

Configuring Conversational Interfaces settings for ServiceNow NLU

To help with tracking NLU performance, you must first configure the Conversational Interfaces (CI) settings in Virtual Agent. To access these settings, navigate to the top of the NLU Model Performance for Virtual Agent landing page and click Conversational Interfaces Settings. This action takes you to the CI settings page in Virtual Agent, as shown in the image below.

To configure the settings, you need to use the virtual_agent_admin or admin role. For configuration guidance, see Implement NLU in Virtual Agent and Enable NLU languages in Virtual Agent settings.

# Reviewing the user interface (UI)

The NLU Model Performance UI is comprised of the listed parts below, which are highlighted in the following image that shows the NLU Model Performance default landing page.

- The Performance tab and its colored chart which shows data describing scenarios that occur when users interact with VA. This chart is segmented in shades of three colors, each representing a user scenario. The rows in the chart that have text and percentages are referred to as the legend. The three scenarios in the first row of the legend have two outcome scenarios beneath them in the second row. The bars underneath the legend correspond to the colors of the scenarios above them. These bars range in size based on the percentage value for each scenario.
- For example, the dark blue bar shows you that 10% of this batch of VA users confirmed that the system presented them the correct topic to use for their VA chatbot conversation, and that 58% of the users (represented by the dark red bar) confirmed that the topic presented to them was incorrect. Residing between these two scenarios is a scenario showing that 32% of the users (represented by the dark brown bar) didn't make any confirmation at all.
- It's a good idea to toggle the Show all bars filter back and forth at any time to see or hide the colored bars and their associated scenarios in the chart. Note also that when you first access NLU Model Performance, the default view of the chart shows only the first row of scenarios and the first row of bars.
- There are also other views you can see depending on which scenario you're viewing. For example, when you first access NLU Model Performance and you click a scenario in the first row of the legend, the system hides the bars of the other two scenarios. This helps.

to keep the UI less cluttered because it partially isolates the scenario you're focusing on from the rest of the scenarios. These actions don't change any data, they simply show you different views of the legend and bars within the chart.

- The Unsupported utterances tab, which shows utterances that are grouped into clusters for use in the performance analysis. This section of the UI is where you can navigate to and return from the Expert Feedback Loop application, and also where you can run the analysis.
- Unsupported utterances are different from irrelevant utterances. For more information, see Irrelevance detection in NLU.
- The Performance Details section located underneath the bar chart. This section has these four columns: Utterance, Predicted intent, Prediction model, and Prediction outcome. The details shown in this section interact with the legend data and bar data above them.

# Reviewing the VA user scenarios

In the legend section of the UI, the text and percentages are accompanied by Information icons. Point to an icon to invoke the definition for its user scenario. Refer to the table below to see the definitions.

# Using the Language and Model filters

On the Performance tab, you can see the Language and Model filters. Next to them, you can also see the most recent Date range values you set above the legend and bars of the chart. Click the Language filter to see all languages that are available in NLU. Click the Model filter to see all prediction models that are available in your instance. The default setting for the Language filter is All languages, and the default setting for the Model filter is All models.

The Language and Model filters interact with each other. For example, if you choose French-fr in the Language filter, the Model filter automatically shows all prediction models in your instance that use the French language, as shown in the following image.

There are other interactions. For example, from the default view of the NLU Model Performance landing page:

# Performance Analysis Guide

If you select a specific model from the Model filter, the Language filter value is updated to display the language of the selected model.

If you select a specific language from the Language filter, the Model filter only displays models of that selected language.

Underneath the Language and Model filters, you can see the Include translated conversations switch. To include the performance of VA conversations that were translated to your primary language using dynamic language translation, toggle the switch to the right so it changes color from grey to green. When you do this, the bars in the charts legend may also change position and colors. You can manage dynamic language translation in the Conversational Interfaces Settings.

# Setting the Date range

On the Performance tab, use the Date range to define how far back you want the system to pull VA data from. Choose Past 30 days, Past 60 days, Past 90 days, or Custom range. The further back you go in the date range, the more data you will have in your analysis.

# Running an analysis

To run a performance analysis, click the Unsupported utterances tab. This section of the UI shows rows of expandable clusters containing VA utterances where NLU didn't make a topic prediction, or where the VA end-user confirmed that the predicted topic was incorrect. The next thing you want to do is to click Expert Feedback Loop. This action takes you to the NLU Expert Feedback Loop application where you review and provide feedback on the utterances that were pulled in from VA.

# Reviewing unsupported utterances

When you leave the Expert Feedback Loop application and return to NLU Model Performance, click the caret icon in any cluster to open it. Within the cluster you can then see the top most representative VA utterances, as shown in the following image.

# Summary usage

The Expert Feedback Loop takes data from your instance and provides it to you for feedback. This data comes from your users' Virtual Agent (VA) chat logs and includes utterances from those logs. Using the nlu_admin role, navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Expert Feedback Loop and mark each utterance in a model by confirming whether the utterance is correct (match) or incorrect (mismatch) to an intent. This feedback helps the model to continuously improve the model performance.

# Installation

Expert Feedback Loop is part of the NLU Workbench - Advanced Features app available on the ServiceNow® Store.

To use Expert Feedback Loop, ensure that the NLU Workbench - Advanced Features (sn_nlu_workbench) plugin is active on your instance. For more information, see Install NLU Workbench - Advanced Features and Activate the NLU Workbench.

Because Expert Feedback Loop relies on the data from VA chat logs, make sure that the Glide Virtual Agent (com.glide.cs.chatbot) plugin is also active. See Activate Virtual Agent.

# Importing expert feedback loop data between instances

Before you start an import, make sure you have access to the data in your instance and have enough data to proceed with your feedback.

# Feedback Data Import and NLU Model Improvement

If you're working in a sub-production instance, you must import the feedback data from the open_nlu_predict_intent_feedback table in your production instance to your sub-production instance. For guidance on how to import, see Importing from another ServiceNow instance.

# Data Scenarios Regarding System Behavior for NLU Models

- If you move a model to a different instance, the feedback data persists.
- If you upgrade the instance, the feedback data persists.
- If you clone an instance, the data does not persist, so you need to follow the procedure referenced above to import the data onto the cloned instance.

# Feedback Context and Access

The Expert Feedback Loop provides a mechanism for you to improve NLU models deployed to VA through feedback that you provide on a select subset of utterances. For each utterance, you are asked to confirm the predicted intent or to provide the correct intent that the utterance belongs to. After this feedback is complete, the data is used to tune the model performance, resulting in an improved model that can now be redeployed to gather more end user data. This is an iterative cycle that allows the system to continuously collect data, learn from the feedback you provide, and use that feedback to further improve your NLU models.

Once every 30 days, the system pulls up to 300 utterance samples from VA chat logs to the Expert Feedback Loop. The utterances are selected for feedback based on how well they represent all the utterances in the logs. Every utterance sampled from VA chat logs has a predicted intent picked by the system.

You can also set the number of utterances you want to be pulled from VA chat logs by adjusting the setting for the glide.mlpredictor.option.nlu.activeLearning.label_candidate_table.max_response_size system property.

Further information on the process of pulling utterances from VA chat logs can be found in the sections Procuring additional VA feedback data on demand and Using the Active Learning job, below.

# Reviewing Your VA Chat Log Utterances

Now that you're in the loop, you can see in the following image a list of NLU utterances that support the intents in the VA models. Each page of the list shows approximately 20 utterances per page. Your goal is to review each utterance and mark its relationship status to a given VA intent. You mark each utterance with either the NLU_Match, Mismatch, or Unsure value.

Marking an utterance as NLU_Match means that you agree with the NLU prediction for that utterance. Marking an utterance as Mismatch means that the utterance belongs to a different intent, and if you select Mismatch, a dropdown of intents appears so you can select the correct intent. If you aren't sure which intent is correct, you can mark it as Unsure.

Utterances that are marked and saved with the NLU_Match value or the Mismatch value are moved to the Completed reviews section. Utterances that are marked and saved with the Unsure value are moved to the Needs further review section.

Here's a scenario for the basic steps you use to complete your utterance reviews:

1. At the top of the Export Feedback Loop screen, select a model you want to review in the Expert Feedback Loop for prompt. Within this feature, in some ways it doesn't matter which model you choose because these models serve mainly to house the utterances you are marking in your reviews. So in this example scenario, you decide to select the IT Model model, which has five intents and many utterances within each of those intents. The number of utterances you need to review are shown next to the name of the predicted intent, as shown in the following image. The intents in these models are listed in the Predicted intents column on your screen. Although you can review and mark utterances in any of the predicted intents, it's a better idea to complete the reviews consecutively in the order the intents first appear. For example, begin with the ad_password_change intent and then onward to other predicted intents.
2. Click the ad_password_change intent so it loads its utterances into the To do section for your review.
3. Review the 15 utterances in the intent. In this scenario, you've started by correctly marking the I want to change my AD password utterance as a match to the ad_password_change intent.
4. Click Save feedback.

Result: The system moves the utterance you marked over to the Done section of the screen. At the same time, the count of To do utterances drops from 15 to 14, while the count on the Done section rises from 0 to 1. If you had also marked another utterance with the Unsure value and saved that change, the count of utterances in the Needs further review section would also rise from 0 to 1.

Note: If you don't know which intent best matches the utterance, mark it with the Unsure value. This action moves the utterance over to the Needs further review section, giving you time to mark other utterances in the To do section that may be easier to match or mismatch to an intent. You can always return to the Needs further review section to mark utterances that are more difficult to pin down to a specific intent.

Repeat steps 1 through 4 as you move through the remaining intents in the Predicted intents column.

# Marking utterances as matched or mismatched to a VA intent

The utterances in the ad_password_change intent are easy to mark as a match to its predicted intent because there's at least one utterance within the intent that has the word password in it.

When you have finished reviewing the utterances in the predicted intent and you click Save feedback, the screen refreshes to highlight the next predicted intent in the model.

If you want to see your utterances grouped by their value, click the Showing filter and select one of the options in its prompt. The values are All, NLU_Match, and Unsure.

# Using the card view option to review your utterances

Your Expert Feedback Loop utterances appear on the To do section in a list view by default, as shown in many of the images you've seen so far above. However, you can also choose a different view that shows each utterance framed within a card. If you choose this option, each utterance appears on the page in groups of five. While still within the list view, click the card icon.

Result: The card view replaces the list view. Note the left and right arrows on either side of the page of utterance cards. When you click the right arrow, it turns the page to the next set of five cards. When you click the left arrow, it turns the page to the previous set of five cards.

you want to switch back to the list view instead of the card view, click the list icon as shown in the upper right hand corner of the image below.

# Changing an utterance value

If you mark an utterance but then change your mind on the value you chose, you can resolve the issue by clicking on MisMatch and selecting another intent. Click Save feedback to save the change.

# Unsaved feedback

If you finish and log out of a session of marking your utterances, but forget to save your changes, select Unsaved changes from the Showing prompt. This action displays all the utterances you have given feedback for but haven't saved yet.

# Reviewing uncategorized utterances

As part of the feed from VA chat logs to the Expert Feedback Loop, the system collects and displays in a list any utterances in your instance that aren't part of a VA intent. You access these utterances by selecting Uncategorized in the Expert Feedback Loop for prompt at the top of your screen.

When the screen refreshes, these utterances are shown in the Utterance column of the Uncategorized utterances section of your screen.

Important: It is extremely important to provide feedback on this set of utterances because the system is suggesting there is no associated intent for these utterances. By confirming this lack of association or by associating these utterances with an existing intent, you are helping the model to learn correctly.

# Here are the steps you use to connect an uncategorized utterance to an intent:

1. In the Utterance column, select an utterance from the list.
2. In the Corrected Intent column, search and select an intent and its model from the prompt that you think is the best match for the utterance.

For example, a good pairing for this connection is the Can I trade my ESPP? utterance from the Utterance column and the 401kBenefitsInquiry intent from the Corrected Intent column, as shown in the image below.

Note: The Corrected Intent column enables you to search for and use all intents across all models in your instance.

# Pairing an uncategorized utterance with an intent and its model

Regarding the image above, let's cover a few items that help describe how the uncategorized utterances page works, as follows. The To do section collects utterances that must be connected to an intent. On this particular day we see there are 120 such utterances. Note that the Done section on the screen has no utterances because you've not taken any action yet.

Note also that there's a vertical bar to the far right of the screen where you can scroll up and down to navigate the list of utterances. At the bottom of this scrolling screen, there are arrows that point left and right so you can to turn to the next or previous page of the full utterance list for the day.

---

Note also that when you do take action to make a connection, the Save feedback button, normally active by default, deactivates because the system recognizes your action and automatically saves your change.

# Expert Feedback Loop data in the Tune Model phase

The Tune model button in the Expert Feedback Loop is always enabled and supports the experience of moving utterances from the Expert Feedback Loop Done tab to the model and its test set. Use the nlu_admin role to click this button any time you need to tune or retune your model.

After reviewing utterances in the Expert Feedback Loop, you can push a portion of the feedback data to the default test set of your model. These utterances are then directly added to the Test utterances tab of your model. This helps you to continuously maintain and update your test set with real end user utterances. The system tracks the source of the test utterances for visibility into whether they came from the Expert Feedback Loop or from another source.

If you click the Tune model button before you have marked and saved at least 100 utterances, the screen refreshes to remind you that your model performance increases in quality when you have passed the 100 utterance feedback goal, as referenced in the text in the image below.

As you keep marking and saving your feedback data, you can see the ratio of reviewed utterances (in green), and those that are still available for review (in white) on the progress bar image below.

On the Tune your model image below, you can see the default 60/40 percentage split for your model training set and your model test set. You can adjust these default values if needed by selecting your own chosen numbers in each of the two (%) boxes. Once you're satisfied with your percentage split, click the Tune button to tune your model based on the percentage values you chose.

Note: If you click the View feedback caret, it takes you to an Expert Feedback Loop screen where you can continue reviewing, marking, and saving your feedback utterances.

# Summary usage and roles

Use the nlu_admin or admin role to access IAR Tuning in the NLU Workbench. IAR Tuning in the NLU Workbench requires at least the nlu_feedback_admin role. Note that the nlu_admin role contains the nlu_feedback_admin role. Also, the virtual_agent_admin role contains the nlu_admin role.

If you click on the IAR model name, you will be taken straight to tuning, in the product. You will not be taken to a model overview page, so this behavior differs from Virtual Agent or AI Search models in the NLU Workbench.

# The IAR Tuning workflow

IAR admins begin their model tuning journey in the IAR Admin Console, and then land in the NLU Workbench to tune their ITSM model. If they haven't trained the ITSM model in the console yet, the workflow sends them to the Expert Feedback Loop documentation under the Boost your model performance section of the NLU Workbench.

# How IAR models differ from NLU models

Unlike the Virtual Agent and AI Search tabs, the IAR tab doesn't use a Create new model button. The IAR-ITSM model that IAR admins use is a prebuilt model. IAR models can't be moved using update sets.

# Exploring the NLU Workbench

At the top of the NLU Workbench page are three tabs that group Virtual Agent, Issue Auto Resolution, and AI Search models separately. Below those tabs are a list of models colored grey. In the Model column of the list, if you click the caret to the left of the model name, the model changes color from grey to white and opens to show the model's languages; status; usage; model type; number of enabled intents and mapped intents and the date when the model was last modified or last published.

# Issue Auto Resolution tuning options

When you are tuning your Issue Auto Resolution model in NLU Workbench, you can adjust the output for several goals: precision, automation, or a balance of the two. Compare how your choice of tuning options affect match rate and coverage, before committing.

# Summary usage

By default, Issue Auto Resolution tuning in NLU Workbench optimizes for precision. Depending on your business requirements, you can also tune the model for other objectives. In the Analyze step of Issue Auto Resolution tuning, the tuning goals list enables you to adjust for Precision, Automation, or Balance. As you select one of these options, the projected Match rate and IAR coverage percentages change accordingly, so you can compare possible outcomes.

To access the Analyze step of IAR tuning, use the nlu_admin role and navigate as follows.

1. Navigate to All > NLU Workbench > Models.
2. Select the Issue Auto Resolution tab, then select the model name. The tuning experience opens to step 1 (Feedback) initially.
3. Provide feedback, then select the Analyze button. Step 2 (Analyze) opens.
4. In the section Here are your tuning options and projected results, using the list You can tune for precision, automation, or balance, select options to see projected scenarios. You can also select the link Learn about tuning goals to open the following window.

# Precision

When tuned for precision, the IAR model makes predictions only when its confidence is relatively high. This results in lower error rates, but also in fewer incidents resolved.

---


# Precision

Precision is the recommended tuning option for the IAR ITSM model, so this option is selected by default.

# Automation

When tuned for automation, the IAR model makes predictions at a lower confidence threshold. This results in more predictions, so more incidents are resolved. However, higher error rates are possible.

# Balance

When tuned for balance, the IAR model attempts to strike a balance between precision and automation.

# Match rate

The match rate is defined as the number of Incidents where the intent was predicted correctly, divided by the number of predictions for that intent. This ratio is averaged across all intents except for NO_INTENT.

# IAR Coverage

Coverage is defined as the percentage of Incidents that would be resolved because the model was able to make predictions above its confidence threshold. The predictions may contain some errors.

# Using tuning options

Select several different tuning options to compare projected results. Depending on the option you select, the system presents scenarios for projected Match rates and IAR coverage rates. Also the system displays how much these rates change according to your selection.

Review further information in the Here's a detailed breakdown section of Analyze. Here you can drill down into results that are specific for each intent in the model.

Note that the intents are grouped into mapped and unmapped intents, depending on whether they have been mapped to Virtual Agent topics. After providing feedback in IAR Tuning, you may wish to activate some intent-to-topic mappings. To do so, expand See unmapped intents, then select the Map more intents button. This opens the IAR Admin Console.

When you have decided the optimum tuning option for your requirements, select the Save choice button in the Learn about tuning goals window. Then, select the Tune and publish model button to advance to the next step.

# Intent Discovery

Use the Intent Discovery application to help identify opportunities for incident deflection. For example, you can use it to identify which Virtual Agent conversations to activate next.

# Summary usage

For applications that consume NLU, such as Virtual Agent and AI Search, Intent Discovery helps you to better understand which prebuilt intents you can benefit from, and which custom intents would be useful to create.

Intent Discovery provides an analysis that you run on historic incident data or other task data. You can also group the run’s remaining records into different clusters so you can manually.

# Intent Discovery

Add utterances to NLU intents. In addition, you can use specific clusters to create new intents in a model.

In this example scenario, you're using Intent Discovery to identify the top intents in your instance, and how much coverage they can provide across your historic incident records.

# Installation

Intent Discovery is available from the ServiceNow Store. For more information, see Install Intent Discovery.

After Intent Discovery is installed and activated, it appears under All > NLU Workbench > NLU Advanced Features.

Note: Although organized under NLU Advanced Features in the navigation pane, Intent Discovery is a separate application that is not included when installing NLU Workbench - Advanced Features.

# Intent Discovery report details

- When Taxonomy is selected, the generated report contains intent recommendations against the selected taxonomy. A taxonomy is a prebuilt library of intents in a specific domain. While you don't have access to the underlying intents, when you run Intent Discovery against a specific taxonomy, data that maps to any intent in the taxonomy will be identified.
- Unmatched records are the utterances which couldn't match to any intent in the taxonomy.
- Recommended intents are the intents which are found from utterances that data was run on.
- The percentage of Unmatched records (clustered) are the records that aren't classified (records that don't belong to any of the recommended intents).
- The percentage of unmatched records and the number of recommended intents don't need to match. It's a coincidence if they match.

# Creating an Intent Discovery report

1. Using the admin or nlu_admin role, navigate to All > NLU Workbench > NLU Advanced Features > Intent Discovery.
2. Select either Run analysis or Find recommendations.

NLQ overview

NLQ turns your plain-language requests into structured queries of your data. You don't need to know how to use the condition builder, because NLQ constructs and displays the conditions for you.

If you have a role such as itil that can view and interact with tables, you can use NLQ by selecting the natural language filter icon.

NLQ works on any list on the platform. It returns results only from the table or list you query on.

# Find and use the natural language filter

Selecting the natural language filter icon brings up the NLQ interface.

Enter your request in the What do you want to see field, then select Ask. NLQ parses your request, then displays the query in the condition builder. The results of the query are displayed in the list.

With the default configuration of NLQ, you can continue to refine your query by entering another request into the What do you want to see field.

# Using NLQ to build on a previous query

This example image and procedure illustrates how to build a query using NLQ:

1. On the Incident table in the natural language filter, enter show me active hardware tickets and select the Ask button.
2. The condition builder displays All > Active = true > Category = Hardware as the query. The filtered results are displayed in the list.
3. To narrow down the list of results further, enter without assignment group. Notice that as you type, NLQ displays possible matches for columns and fields. Select assignment group from the list of suggestions, and then Ask.

---

# 4.

In the condition builder, NLQ adds >Assignment group is empty to the query. The list refreshes to display only the matching rows.

5. To reset and start a new query, delete everything in the condition builder so that only All remains.

# Useful information

Keep the following information in mind when using NLQ.

- Your requests can contain periods and apostrophes, but not wildcard characters such as asterisks or regex.
- To group by a field or column, that column must be visible in the list view. Use the personalize list icon to hide or display columns.
- For information about querying CMDB tables, see Querying the CMDB.

# Tips for improving your queries

When you select the Tips for improving your queries button, a modal window appears in the user interface. This window offers the following information about terms you can use in your NLQ questions and requests:

- Sorting or grouping: grouped by; sorted by; A-Z; z-a
- Dates: today; yesterday; last; this; next day(s); week(s); quarter(s); year(s)
- Filtering: starts with; ends with; more than; less than; empty; not empty; and; or
- Other information: my; my team; created by; unassigned

# Before you begin

Role required: admin, nlq_admin, or pa_analyst

# About this task

NLQ synonyms enable you to map common words in your users' requests to the columns in your instance tables. When these words are detected in natural-language queries, NLQ replaces them with actual column and table names, then submits the formal query.

Several synonyms are provided in the base system, and you can add more for your use cases and business requirements. Review NLQ logs of actual user utterances to find possible synonyms to add. For more information, see View NLQ logs.

You can create a new synonym, or modify an existing synonym, as follows.

- If any synonym already exists for your target table and column, you must add your new synonym to the current record. Separate multiple synonyms with a comma.
- Synonyms can point to reference fields, using dot-walking. For more information, see Dot-walking examples.
- Synonyms are case-insensitive in queries.
- Synonyms can contain apostrophes and periods, but not commas.
- Synonym records are associated to one table. You can use the same synonym term for more than one table, but you must create a record for each table.

# Procedure

1. Ensure that you are in the application scope you want for your synonym, then navigate to All > NLQ > Synonyms.
2. Select New. If you are updating an existing record, select its Column name in the list.
3. On the form, fill in the fields.

<table>

# Field

Description

You can use the same term for more than one table, but you must create a synonym record for each table. The synonym's mapping is unique to the table.

# Column name

Specific column on the source table.

# Language

Language of the synonym. Should match the language of the source value.

# Synonyms

Words or short phrases that the system should map to column names or tables, when converting the utterance to a formal query.

Separate multiple synonyms with a comma.

# Extend to All Child Tables

Select this option to make any child tables of the source table inherit the synonyms.

# Result

The new synonym is available to your users as soon as they refresh the browser window of the list.

# Example: NLQ Synonym for the Active field

The following image shows an example of an NLQ synonym record for the Active field on a change request. The synonyms open and in progress are replaced by the term active when the system submits a query.

With this synonym record, a user can type show open change requests or change requests in progress and the system displays active change requests.

# Create an NLQ shortcut

Create a semantic shortcut to help improve the ability of NLQ to recognize the various ways your users request data. Semantic shortcuts operate similarly to NLQ synonyms by mapping common words to columns, but for a selected table when certain conditions are met.

# Before you begin

Role required: admin, nlq_admin, or pa_analyst

# About this task

Like NLQ synonyms, semantic shortcuts enable you to map common words in your users' requests to the columns in your instance tables. When these words are detected in natural-language queries, NLQ replaces them with actual column and table names, then submits the formal query.

Semantic shortcuts provide a condition builder so that you can filter which records are covered by the terms you provide.

Some semantic shortcuts are provided in the base system, and you can add more for your use cases and business requirements. Review NLQ logs of actual user utterances to find possible terms to add. For more information, see View NLQ logs.

You can create a new shortcut, or modify an existing shortcut, as follows.

- If any shortcut already exists for your target table and filter conditions, you must add your new shortcut to the current record. Separate multiple shortcuts with a comma.
- Shortcuts can point to reference fields, using dot-walking. For more information, see Dot-walking examples.
- Synonyms are case-insensitive in queries.
- Synonyms can contain apostrophes and periods, but not commas.
- Synonym and shortcut records are associated to one table. You can associate the same synonym term to more than one table, but you must create a record for each table.

# Procedure

1. Ensure that you are in the application scope that you want for your shortcut, then navigate to All > NLQ > Semantic Shortcuts.
2. Select New. If you are updating an existing record, select its row in the list.
3. On the form, fill in the fields.

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>

# Field

Description

Separate multiple synonyms with a comma.

# Application

[Read only] Application scope that can use the synonym in a query. Default is Global. Ensure that you are in the target application scope for your shortcut before creating it.

# 4. Select Submit if new, or Update if you are modifying an existing record.

# Result

The new shortcut is available to your users as soon as they refresh the browser window of the list.

# Example: Semantic shortcut for Incident backlog

The following image shows an example of a semantic shortcut used on incident records. Incidents contain the Assigned to field. Using the condition builder, you can provide synonyms for when the field is empty. When NLQ detects unassigned and backlog in your users' input, it replaces them with the SQL clause assigned_toISEMPTY.

A user can enter show me incident backlog or unassigned incidents and the system displays incidents with an empty Assigned to field.

# What to do next

Based on your users' attempted queries, consider adding more synonyms or shortcuts.

# View NLQ Table Guesser logs

Use the Table Guesser logs to review the CMDB tables that were picked by NLQ in response to plain-language queries.

# Before you begin

This module is read-only.

Role required: nlq_admin.

# About this task

When a plain-language request for CMDB data is parsed by NLQ, the system tries to determine the specific tables the user intended. The system's guesses, including confidence levels, are recorded in the NLQ Table Guesser logs module [nlq_table_guesser_log].

Review these logs to troubleshoot which CMDB tables were inferred by NLQ.

Note: This list is read-only for NLQ admins. There are no buttons or actionable functions in the UI.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > NLQ > Table Guesser Logs.
2. Select the personalize list icon ( ) to display the columns Matched words to table names and Confidence scores. The Utterance column shows the user's natural language query.
3. Use the information in the Matched words to table names column for troubleshooting if needed. In this column's value field, the first word was found in the utterance. Next is a list of the CMDB tables that were matched to that word.

# What to do next

# Predictive model components

A predictive model includes these components, some of which you must provide.

# Solution definition

A data record you create and configure that specifies these values for training a predictive model.

- The records used to train the model. For example, only train on incidents that are resolved or closed within the last six months.
- The input fields that the model uses to make predictions. For example, use the incident short description to make a prediction.
- The output field whose value the model predicts. For example, set the incident category based on the short description.
- The frequency to retrain the model. For example, retrain the model every 30 days.

# Solution

The solution is the result of a solution definition that you've trained in a ServiceNow datacenter. Predictive Intelligence uses the solution to predict a target field value given one or more input field values. All solutions specify these values.

- The solution precision is the aggregate percentage of correct predictions. For example, a precision of 50 means that out of 100 predictions, half of them should have the correct value.
- The solution coverage is the aggregate percentage of records that receive a prediction. For example, a coverage of 50 means half of all eligible records actually receive a prediction.
- The solution classes are the output field values for which the model can make predictions. Each class is an output field value with a list of possible precision, coverage, and distribution metrics to choose from. For example, the Incident Categorization solution has a class for each category such as software, inquiry, and database.
- The class distribution is the percentage of records from the entire table that have this particular output field value. For example, a distribution of 50 for the inquiry class means that half of incidents have the inquiry category.

# Predictive Intelligence frameworks

Predictive Intelligence provides three frameworks in the Zurich release. Each framework has different solution types to train the system to predict, recommend, and organize data outcomes. A trained solution can be invoked by any application through an API to make a prediction. More information can be found in Predictive Intelligence frameworks.

# Predictive Intelligence frameworks

Predictive Intelligence provides three different model frameworks in the Zurich release: classification, similarity, and clustering. Each framework specializes in different types of predictions.

# Predictive Intelligence classification framework

The Predictive Intelligence classification framework enables you to use machine-learning algorithms to set categorical field values during record creation. For example, you can use the model to set the incident category based on the short description. You can train predictive models so they act as an agent to categorize and route work automatically based on your past record-handling experience.

Enable Predictive Intelligence to handle volumes of incoming requests at lower costs. Automate the categorization and assignment of requests to reduce:

- Task resolution times.
- The number of interactions required to resolve tasks.
- The error rates of categorizing and assigning work.

For more information, see Create and train a classification solution.

# Predictive Intelligence similarity framework

The Predictive Intelligence similarity framework identifies existing records that have similar values to a new record. For example, you can train a subset of your incident records to recommend a resolution based on the information of a similar incident record. By borrowing from similar closed incidents that have a proven resolution, you can help agents and fulfillers quickly provide the best resolution for an incoming incident.

The similarity framework doesn't need an exact match of keywords for its text comparisons because its algorithms identify similar words and synonyms based on similar contexts. For example, the phrases printer not working and printer broken are both recognized as similar. The framework also collects, learns, and applies your industry-specific context. For example, the phrase unable to join network has a different context in a computer networking company than it does in a healthcare insurance company.

The similarity framework uses a workflow similarity solution. For more information, see Create and train a similarity solution.

# Predictive Intelligence clustering framework

Clustering divides data into groups that can then be used to identify patterns. You can then address records collectively or find gaps in existing data. For example, you can group similar new incidents to identify a major outage.

The clustering framework uses a workflow clustering solution. For more information, see Create and train a clustering solution.

# Deprecated in the Washington DC release: Predictive Intelligence regression framework

Important: Support for creating new regression solutions was removed in the Washington DC release. You can train and edit existing solutions, but you can't create new ones. This information is provided for legacy context.

# Regression

Regression is a machine-learning framework that uses historic data to predict numeric outputs, such as a temperature or a stock price.

For more information, see Create and train a regression solution.

# Install Predictive Intelligence

Activate Predictive Intelligence on your instance and get started with basic configuration.

# Before you begin

Role required: admin

# About this task

The Predictive Intelligence plugin (com.glide.platform_ml) is included in the base system, but if necessary you can use the following procedure to activate it.

Other related plugins and store applications are available. For example, Predictive Intelligence for Field Service Management (com.snc.fsm_ml) provides solutions relevant to FSM. Some of these plugins may require a separate license.

When you activate the Predictive Intelligence plugin for the first time on your instance, the system launches a Homepage. The Homepage provides an overview of your solution definitions in the classification, similarity, clustering, and regression frameworks. You can create, train, and test solutions directly on the Homepage. A summary of the latest trained solution is also available.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to System Definition > Plugins.
2. Use the search bar to locate the Predictive Intelligence (com.glide.platform_ml) plugin.
3. Select Install and then in the Activate Plugin dialog box, select Activate. When you activate a plugin, any dependent plugins are activated automatically.
4. Confirm that the activation has successfully created a sharedservice.worker user. When training your solutions, Predictive Intelligence operates as this user.

Note: The sharedservice.worker user includes the following roles:

- platform_ml_read
- platform_ml_write
- platform_ml_create

These roles are required to create, train, and view solutions. They are internal roles and not meant to be edited or assigned to other users.

# Implement Predictive Intelligence

Implement initial setup and configuration steps for Predictive Intelligence to train a machine-learning (ML) algorithm to make predictions based on your past record data.

# Before you begin

Role required: admin or ml_admin

# About this task

The training process requires sending record data to a training service in the nearest datacenter. Since every datacenter has its own dedicated training server and the data doesn't leave the datacenter, this service is also available to customers who have data.

# Procedure

1. Activate Predictive Intelligence on a non-production instance.
2. From your production instance, export the records that you want your Predictive Intelligence solutions to process. For example, export 12 months of incident records to a non-production instance.
3. On the non-production instance, import the records you exported.
4. On the non-production instance, review the default solution definition records to determine if the filter, input fields, and output field are sufficient to predict your incident or task records. If necessary, create a solution definition for each record set you want to predict.
5. On the non-production instance, train the solution definition records.
6. Test the solution predictions on the non-production instance by either creating test records or importing more records from production.
7. For classification solutions, review the prediction reports to determine the accuracy and coverage of your solution and individual classes.
8. For similarity solutions, review the similarity examples to update the similarity score threshold if needed.
9. If necessary, update the solution definition filter to include more or different training records.
10. Retrain and retest any updated solution definition records.
11. When you are satisfied with your solutions, activate Predictive Intelligence on your production instance.
12. Recreate any custom solution definition records and train the solution, or import the solution from your non-production instance to your production instance.

# Configuration tips for Predictive Intelligence

If you encounter issues during your solution training and solution prediction, follow these suggested resolutions.

# Input Data

It is recommended to have at least 30,000 records to train your models with, but the accuracy of the model is determined by the input data.

There are three primary factors that determine the quality of the input data used to train solutions:

- Cleanliness: Sanitized data reduces noise, making the model more accurate.
- Quality: The input and output should be valid and correct to train the model to make accurate predictions.
- Distribution: Data that represents the entire dataset as a whole will result in a model that can make more generalized predictions.

Most raw data sets contain dirty and unusable data. Reviewing your input sets before training is essential to keeping accurate predictive models.

It is recommended to use approximately 80% of your input data to train your model and about 20% of the data to evaluate whether the model is accurate. You can compare the model's predicted results against the real values for the 20% of remaining data.

# Solution training

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Issue</th>
<th>Resolution or suggested action</th>

<tr>
<td>The solution training remains in Waiting for Training status for too long, as the scheduler job is using an incorrect Glide callback instance URL.</td>

# Issue

# Resolution or suggested action

The solution training fails due to user authentication.

Navigate to System Security > Users and ensure the sharedservice.worker user is set to Active.

The model training returns saying the model cannot be created. The training fails and shows the “Error while training solution” message. The training progress window shows this message: “Solution training failed as either the data used isn't sufficient or the input field isn't predictive of the output field."

This issue can occur when the data quantity or the distribution of field values isn't sufficient for a model to build successfully. Follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. Ensure the distribution of the output field isn't skewed.
2. Retrain the model by changing the date filters to use a larger amount of data.
3. If the input fields are not fully populated, add a filter to remove null records.

The solution has data in multiple languages but the coverage and precision results are poor.

Use the following options to help improve your metrics.

Option 1: Update the processing language of the solution to the most prominent non-English language.

Note: English is applied by default for all datasets.

Option 2: If there's sufficient data for each language/region:

1. Add a filter criteria for a specific language/region where the primary language can be identified (Dutch, English, French, German, Japanese, or Spanish).
2. Generate a solution for each language/region and apply the proper processing language to each solution.

# Solution prediction

# Issue

# Resolution or suggested action

The prediction fails and returns a Java exception where the cause is unknown.

1. Search for the exception in the Predictive Intelligence Glide logs.
2. Submit an Incident record for Predictive Intelligence including all relevant details, such as the exception, the impacted instance, the solution name, and the input string.

---



# Issue

# Resolution or suggested action

There is no prediction applied to the incident/case record but the prediction returns a value when tested in the Rest API Explorer.

This can occur when the confidence of the prediction is less than the threshold required to make a prediction. After your solution is trained, use the following steps to confirm if your solution settings need adjusting.

1. Navigate to System Web Services > REST > REST API Explorer to find the confidence level for the prediction. See Test a classification solution prediction.
2. On your ML Solution Definition record, check the threshold set for your outcome class that was returned in the prediction by clicking on the name of the class. The Class page appears.
3. Check the Estimated Precision and Estimated Coverage values. If the corresponding threshold is more than the prediction confidence of the outcome, this is the root cause for why you did not see any prediction.
4. Adjust the class precision and coverage values to increase coverage or precision. See Tune a trained classification solution.

# Instance cloning

# Issue

After an instance is cloned, predictions for your existing solutions fail.

The ML solution artifacts in the [ml_artifacts] table are stored in the [sys_attachment table]. If the [ml_artifacts] table isn't included in the clone when you run it, the predictions fail. Ensure your clone includes the machine-learning artifacts, as these are critical components of your Predictive Intelligence solution.

After an instance is cloned, the solution training fails.

As the cloning run proceeds, it is possible that the sharedservice.worker user has either been inactivated, locked out, or the user ID isn't set. Resolve these problems so that the solution training succeeds.

# About this task

Stopwords lists enable the system to exclude extraneous words that can impede search and the overall natural language processing of your data.

Predictive Intelligence provides you with default stopwords lists for each language the system supports. Examples of stopwords include words such as in, the, and the names of people and companies. You can also define your own stopwords list that's comprised of words specific to your organization and industry.

The custom list you provide works alongside those that the system already uses by default. For example, if incident records are used in a classification solution, and a company name is used in those records, consider adding that name to your list, as it's unlikely to provide any relevant information for the solution you're building.

In this example scenario, you create a custom stopwords list for the Brazilian Portuguese language.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > Predictive Intelligence > Stopwords.
2. On the Stopwords list, click New.
3. In the Stopwords form, configure these fields.

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Name</td>
<td>Enter a unique name for the list, such as the name of your company and the processing language. For example, Blitzo Brazilian Portuguese Stopwords.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stopwords Language</td>
<td>Select Brazilian Portuguese</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stopwords List</td>
<td>Manually enter the stopwords using a comma-separated format. For more examples of stopwords, see the image in Step 2 of this procedure.</td>
</tr>

# 4. Click Submit.

Your custom stopwords list appears in the Stopwords list view.

# 5. Optional: If you need to update your stopwords list, just click its Name, add or remove words from the list, and click Update.

# What to do next

Assign a custom or default stopwords list to a classification, similarity, clustering, or regression solution definition.

# Create a word corpus

Build a collection of words and phrases that functions as the vocabulary the system uses to compare your instance records based on their textual similarity. You can think of the word corpus as a dictionary that you want your machine-learning system to understand.

Important: In the Zurich release, models in the classification, clustering, and similarity frameworks use Workflow solutions. These are pre-trained, so a word corpus isn't needed for your new solutions.

After upgrading, your existing solutions with a word corpus become Workflow solutions the next time they are re-trained. Also the Word Corpus field is removed from the form.

The following information is provided for legacy context.

# About this task

The primary purpose for a word corpus is to infer textual data for training your NLU model. If using a word corpus in a solution, you must specify it for training in the solution definition phase of a solution. A trained word corpus can be reused across solutions and capabilities.

You can use a word corpus to help compare similar record text in a table or across multiple tables. A word corpus can also be helpful in other scenarios, such as clustering, where you group similar records together for data analysis, reuse, or review. The items you add to your corpus should be specific to your company and your industry so you can reuse it in other similarity or clustering solutions and apply it to various use cases.

In this example procedure, you're working on incident records and you want to locate relevant knowledge base (KB) articles that could provide resolutions to those incident cases. Your goal here is to create a word corpus that you can apply to a new similarity solution that compares active incidents to published KB articles.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > Predictive Intelligence > Word Corpus.
2. In the Word Corpus form, click New.
3. Configure these fields according to the following guidance.

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Name</td>
<td>A unique title that references the contents of your corpus. For example, in this use case you could enter a name such as Active Incidents and Published KBs, as the name indicates the tables that your corpus will mine to help create your solution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Active</td>
<td>Select this check box if you're creating more than one word corpus at a time and you plan to configure their detail components later. Otherwise, leave it blank because you can select it in a later step.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

Select Submit.
In the Word Corpus list view, locate your new word corpus and click its Name value to open the record.
In the Word Corpus Contents section, Click New.
In the Word Corpus Content form, configure these fields per the following guidance to define a content component for your word corpus.

# Quick start tests for Predictive Intelligence

Validate that Predictive Intelligence still works after you make any configuration change such as applying an upgrade or developing an application. Copy and customize these quick start tests to pass when using your instance-specific data.

Predictive Intelligence quick start tests require activating the Predictive Intelligence [com.glide.platform_ml] plugin. In order to execute critical upgrade tests on existing machine learning solutions, you need to create a basic authorization profile named ml_atf in the Basic Auth Configurations table (sys_auth_profile_basic.list). To run the tests successfully, the user attached to the ml_atf authorization profile must have the ml_admin role.

# Activate solution version

The system activates the most recent version of the solution when it completes training a solution, and only allows one solution version to be active at a time. However, you can activate any previously trained solution version you want Predictive Intelligence to use to make predictions.

# Before you begin

- Manually train a solution multiple times or set a training schedule.
- Role required: admin or ml_admin

# About this task

The system creates a solution version each time you train a solution definition. Typically, you only manually create a new solution version when you change the solution definition filter and want to test it. Otherwise, most solution versions are created during scheduled solution training.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > Predictive Intelligence > Classification > Solutions or Predictive Intelligence > Similarity > Solutions or Predictive Intelligence > Clustering > Solutions or Predictive Intelligence > Regression > Solutions.
2. In the ML Solutions list view, click the Reference Lookup icon for the trained solution that you want to activate.
3. Click Open Record.
4. In the solution record, click Activate. The system activates this solution version and deactivates any other solution version.

# What to do next

For classification solutions, review the trained solution precision and coverage statistics. For similarity solutions, review the similarity examples.

# Export trained solutions to production

Refine and test your ML solutions iteratively on a non-production instance, and then use update sets to export the changes to your production instance. This practice mitigates the risk of retraining solutions on your live production instance.

# Before you begin

Prior to testing on a test instance, ensure that the instance hosts recently-cloned data from your production instance so that the solutions you train on the test instance remain valid when you export them to production.

Role required: admin or ml_admin

# About this task

Plan your changes carefully, and remember that update sets match records based on the system ID [sys-id] and not the version number. Note that moving solutions to instances can sometimes deliver unpredictable results. If you run into such an issue, retrain the solution again, which takes 5 minutes per solution. For more information on update sets, see System update sets.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > Predictive Intelligence > Classification > Solution Definitions or Predictive Intelligence > Similarity > Solution Definitions.
2. Click the name of your trained ML Solution Definition record to open it.
3. In the Related Links section, click Add solutions to the current update set.
4. Click Update.

# Result

Your trained ML solution artifacts, such as solution definitions, template records, and predictive model statistics, are added to the current update set.

# What to do next

Depending on where you are in your solution testing, schedule your update set for export to another non-production instance for further testing, or on to production.

Note: After you export a similarity solution, click Refresh similarity window (Required after Solution Import) in the Related Links section of the corresponding ML Solution Definition form.

# Configuring advanced settings for your ML solutions

Learn about advanced settings for your Predictive Intelligence machine learning (ML) solutions. Apply optional technology and algorithms for classification, clustering, similarity, and regression capabilities.

Using advanced settings in your ML solutions is optional. If you choose to implement any of these settings, make sure you're well informed regarding the technology you're enabling in the solution, and that your use case benefits from what the technology offers. For more information about several of these parameters, see the Dive deeper with Clustering Advanced Parameters article on ServiceNow Community.

Most of the advanced settings are limited to only one capability because their functionality is targeted to specific use cases.

# Classification, clustering, similarity, and regression advanced settings

Using the admin or ml_admin role, you apply these technologies by configuring a parameter in the Advanced Solution Settings tab on your ML solution definition form.

To update or remove an existing setting: on the solution definition form, select the Advanced Solution Settings tab, then select the name of the solution parameter. For details, see the following procedures.

- Configure class recall for a classification solution
- Configure TF-IDF for solutions
- Configure DBSCAN for a clustering solution
- Configure HDBSCAN for a clustering solution
- Configure XGBoost for classification or regression solutions
- Configure Connect Component algorithm and Levenshtein Distance method for a clustering solution
- Apply purity on a clustering solution
- Analyze a cluster with Cluster Insight

# Advanced Solution Settings for Classification

From the Zurich release, classification solutions offer the following advanced solution settings.

- Config parameters for model config in classification
- Configure include only top N labels
- Minimum records needed for label to include it
- Remove others label
- Use LightGBM algo for classification model training

# Configure class recall for a classification solution

Create and apply a class recall parameter to an ML solution prior to training its data. For example, you set and apply this solution parameter to 90% recall for all records in the Email class.

# Before you begin

Note: Using advanced settings in your ML solutions is optional. If you choose to implement any of these settings, make sure you're well informed regarding the technology you're enabling in the solution, and that you have a use case that benefits from what the technology offers.

- Create and save a classification solution definition or use an existing one.
- Role required: admin or ml_admin

# About this task

The class recall solution parameter enables you to steer a solution's training to bias a specific class. For example, classifying an incoming email as a Phish or not can be an important use case in a security-related machine learning solution. In this situation, it's very important to identify every Phish, and it may be acceptable to report a non-Phish as a Phish occasionally. However, no actual Phish should be classified as a non-Phish. In such situations, the recall metric must have a high value to minimize false negatives. High recall values might lead to lower percentages for precision and coverage.

# 5. Add your values to the User inputs field, in the format ClassName:RecallValue.

a. Enter the name of the class for which you want to specify a recall value. In this scenario, you enter Phish for the ClassName.

b. Enter a colon character (:), then the Recall value. Enter 95 for the RecallValue in the example scenario.

In other words you're specifying Phish as the target class, and 95 is the Recall percentage you're requesting the system to deliver during solution training (Phish:95).

# 6. Select Submit.

Result: Class recall is configured for your classification solution. Its solution parameter appears on the Advanced Solution Settings tab of your classification solution definition form.

# What to do next

Train your saved classification solution so that your updates are incorporated.

# About this task

Predictive Intelligence uses paragraph vector word embedding by default in its classification and similarity frameworks, which is highly effective for processing data comprised of primarily human-readable content. However, TF-IDF might return better prediction results for records that have machine-generated content, such as alerts and error messages for log files. Choose advanced settings that are appropriate for the kind of data your solution is processing.

Note: The steps for configuring TF-IDF are the same for all model frameworks, but TF-IDF support for clustering solution definitions is applicable only if you have a Professional subscription.

# About this task

Predictive Intelligence uses the k-means algorithm by default in its clustering framework. DBSCAN is another clustering algorithm that's also used in data mining and machine learning. Some users prefer DBSCAN as it doesn't require you to specify the number of clusters in the data before clustering. For a summary of the pros and cons for each algorithm, see this conversation and this article.

In this example scenario, you apply DBSCAN to a clustering solution.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > Predictive Intelligence > Clustering > Solution Definitions.

# About this task

You can apply the HDBSCAN algorithm to help the system identify data samples that aren't assigned to any cluster. For example, you can apply HDBSCAN to support Topic Discovery.

Predictive Intelligence implements the k-means algorithm by default in its clustering framework. HDBSCAN is similar to the DBSCAN clustering algorithm except that it works with minimum-sized clusters and can help deliver more stable and persistent clusters. For a summary of how HDBSCAN works, see this article. For a comparison between DBSCAN and HDBSCAN, see this article and this article.

Note: Clustering solutions trained with HDBSCAN do not support cluster updates. Updates on these solutions fail and the solutions are not logged in the ml_cluster_detail_table. Use DBSCAN or k-means training methods if you want to enable cluster updates.

# Identifies similarities between new and existing records to recommend resolutions.

See Create and train a similarity solution.

# • Clustering solutions:

Groups similar records into clusters to identify patterns and major incidents. See Create and train a clustering solution.

# • Regression solutions:

Important: With the Zurich release, support for creating new regression solutions was removed. You can still edit and train existing regression solutions, but you won't be able to create new ones.

Uses historic data to predict numeric outputs, such as estimating the time it takes to resolve an incident or case. See Create and train a regression solution.

# Selecting data records for training your solution

A solution is only as good as the record data you use to train it. In general, a good training dataset has these characteristics.

- The solution definition input fields are available to users when creating records. To make predictions at record creation, the solution must have the input field values at record creation.
- The solution definition output field is a choice field. To make more accurate predictions, limit the output field to a finite set of possible values.
- The training records only contain correct values for the output field. To make more accurate predictions, filter out any records that have unreliable output field values. For example, if recently closed incidents are subject to review and change for a month, filter out any recently closed incidents.
- The training records contain multiple examples of each output field value that you want the solution to predict. To provide more record coverage, include multiple examples of each output field value.
- The training records include common variations of the input fields. To provide more record coverage, include multiple examples of input field values.

# Exporting your solution for training

To train a solution, you export its solution definition and associated records to a centralized training server within the same datacenter. When the training completes, the training server exports the solution back to your instance and deletes all of your training data from the server. As every datacenter has its own dedicated training server and the data doesn't leave the datacenter, this service is also available to customers who have data sovereignty requirements.

Predictions occur on a centralized prediction server within the same datacenter as the instance. The trained model artifacts are sent from the instance server to the prediction server when the prediction is invoked for the first time. After that, the trained model artifacts are cached on the prediction server for subsequent predictions.

Note: All communication between the instance and the training service occurs within the same datacenter firewall. Even so, all communications occur over HTTPS.

# Solution training troubleshooting

For troubleshooting common training issues, see the Predictive Intelligence Common issues [KB781893] article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

# Create and train a classification solution

Specify the records used to train a classification solution, what fields trigger a prediction, and how often you want to retrain your solution.

# Before you begin

- Create a custom stopwords list if needed.
- Role required: admin or ml_admin

Important: In the Zurich release, models in the classification, clustering, and similarity frameworks use Workflow solutions. These are pre-trained, so a word corpus isn't needed for your new solutions. When your existing solutions with a word corpus are re-trained after upgrading, they become Workflow solutions, and the Word Corpus field is removed from the form.

# About this task

A predictive model is only as good as the data that you use to train it. To select appropriate records for training, examine the table's database dictionary as well as the current quality of the record values that you want to use.

For information on using encrypted training data, see Data Encryption in Predictive Intelligence.

For information about the minimum and maximum number of records you can use for training, see Predictive Intelligence properties.

Note: Classes that have fewer than 30 records in your training dataset are excluded from solution training. When your solution is trained and complete, any excluded classes are listed in the Solution Statistics section of your ML Solution form.

You must create a separate solution definition for each predictive model you want to support. The following procedure explains how to create a new classification solution, but you can also copy an existing solution definition and its configuration into a new record by selecting Copy Solution Definition from the context menu. Edit the field values on the new record as needed.

From the Yokohama release, you can also create a Workflow Classification solution using a script if you want to include an analysis of the key features influencing the model's predictions. For more information see Model Explainability.

# Procedure

1. Ensure that you are in the application scope you want for your solution definition, then navigate to All > Predictive Intelligence > Classification > Solution Definitions.
2. On the Classification Definitions list, select New.
3. On the empty Classification Definition form, configure the fields according to the following guidance.

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Label</td>
<td>Enter a unique name for the solution record.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Name</td>
<td>The system generates the value of this read-only field based on the Label value that you entered.</td>
</tr>

- It has some causal connection to the input fields.

For example, on the default Incident Categorization solution definition, the output field is set to Category.

# Fields

Select the input fields that you want the solution to use to generate a prediction.

Input fields are fields within a record that may contain the classification information your prediction solution needs to succeed. For example, if you're predicting the correct class for triaging an incident record, the prediction should gather records containing text that references the class. Most records have contextual text in their Short description field, so it's a great input field to use in general. You could also use Resolution notes as an input field, as it too might reference the incident class in the detailed notes for the incident.

In general, good input fields have these characteristics:

- The fields are available to users when creating records.
- The field data type can be string, reference, choice, or HTML. The more information that a field provides, the more often a solution can make a prediction, and the more often predictions are accurate.
- The field has a default value and should not be blank.

All default solution definitions use the Short description field.

# Filter

Click Add Filter Condition to apply conditions to the records you're training.

For example, the Incident Categorization solution definition uses a filter with these conditions: [Created][on][Last 12 months] AND [Active][is][false] AND [State][is one of][Resolved | Closed]

To train a solution, the filter must return at least one record. If your filter returns no records, update it until it returns records for training.

# Field

# Value

Note: The recommended number of records for training a good solution is from 30,000 through 300,000. If you submit more than 300,000 records, the most recent 300,000 records are used to train the solution. Use only authentic records from the database.

# In general, a good filter has these characteristics.

- The training records are inactive and their states indicate work completed within your standard process, such as resolved or closed.
- The target fields contain only correct values. Filter out records with unreliable target field values. For example, if you're predicting the assignment group/category and your historic incident data contains assignment groups/categories that are no longer used, add a filter to remove such records from the training.
- The training records contain multiple examples of each target field value you want the solution to predict.
- The training records include common variations of the input fields.

Use relative date filters such as last 3 months or last 12 months. Don't use hard-coded dates because these filters aren't updated when the solutions are retrained, unless you update them manually.

# Processing Language

Select the dominant language of the dataset that you're training on the solution definition. If the dataset language is Italian, choose Italian. Also, English processing is applied to all datasets by default. For example, if you select Italian, the system processes the data in both English and Italian.

Note: The term processing indicates some of the language-specific steps used as part of training a solution. For example, tokenizing words, removing stop words, and stemming.

# Stopwords

When you select your processing language, the system automatically adds a Stopwords list for that language. For example, if your processing language is Italian, the Default Italian Stopwords list appears. The Default English Stopwords list is also included. If you create a custom stopwords list, you can select it from the Stopwords field to add to your solution.

# Training Frequency

Select how often the system regenerates the solution. The available options range from Run once up to Every 180 days.

Note: The minimum number of records required for classification solution training is set at 10,000.

By default, the system runs training once. This provides you time to review and update the solution definition until it provides acceptable coverage and precision values.

When your solution definition is fairly stable, consider scheduled trainings, as data can age over time, thus degrading the accuracy of your prediction model.

# Exclude a class from prediction

Exclude a class from prediction if its precision or coverage aren't satisfactory. Excluding a class prevents the classification model from predicting a particular output field value.

# Before you begin

- Train the solution definition whose output field values you want to exclude.
- Role required: admin or ml_admin

# About this task

As part of the testing and refinement of your classification solution, you can try excluding an output class to check the effect on the model's results.

Excluding a class from prediction is temporary. The class is restored the next time you train your solution, as long as the solution definition remains the same. If your precision or coverage targets are still not met, consider deactivating the solution or changing the solution definition.

Typically, you exclude a class from prediction if you want a person to manually set the excluded class value. For example, exclude a particular incident category when the solution doesn't offer sufficient precision or coverage, or because the class triggers other business logic that requires review or approval.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > Predictive Intelligence > Classification > Solutions.
2. In the ML Solutions list, select the solution whose classes you want to exclude. This solution must have a State of Solution Complete.
3. In the Class Confidence related list, select the class you want to exclude.
4. In the Class Confidence record, review the precision and coverage combinations available from the Precision Coverage Lookups embedded list.
5. Select the check box for the 100 precision and 0 coverage combination.



---


# 6. From the Actions on selected rows control, select Apply Values.

The system shows a Precision / Coverage Setting confirmation window.

# 7. Click OK to confirm the change or Cancel to discard it.

# Result

The solution excludes the class from all predictions until the next training cycle.

# What to do next

If you conclude that this class does not contribute to meaningful predictions, consider deactivating the solution or changing the solution definition.

# Exclude a class from solution training

Exclude a class from solution training to prevent the model from ever making predictions for a particular output field class. For example, you can exclude a particular incident category from training if you plan to retire or change the category.

# Before you begin

Role required: admin or ml_admin

# About this task

Excluding a class from training doesn't prevent the solution from making predictions for records that use the excluded class. Solution training still uses the input and output field values as data and attempts to match input field values to a new output field class. This attempt may cause undesirable prediction results unless you have another suitable class to replace the excluded class value.

Typically, you only exclude a class from training if you change the list of valid output field values. For example, if you replaced one incident category with another incident category, you may exclude the old category from training so that the solution only uses the new category for predictions.

Note: If you specify a target recall for a class, don't exclude the class from training even if the number of records are less than 30 for that class.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > Predictive Intelligence > Classification > Solution Definitions. The system shows the current list of solution definitions.
2. Select the solution definition you want to edit.
3. Example: For example, select Incident Categorization to exclude an incident category from training.
4. Edit the filter to exclude the class. You can use the [is one of] or [is not one of] operators to exclude a particular class.
5. Example: For example, if you want to exclude the Hardware class, add this condition: [Category] [is not one of] [Hardware].
6. Click Update &#x26; Train. The system schedules the solution for training with the nearest training service. When training is complete, the system uploads the solution as an Attachment record.

# Result

The solution excludes the class from all predictions.

# What to do next

Review the trained solution precision and coverage statistics.

# Tune a trained classification solution

Tune the performance of a trained classification solution by configuring class level precision and coverage values.

# Before you begin

- Train the solution definition whose output field values you want to configure.
- Role required: admin or ml_admin

# About this task

The system creates a class record for each output field value that it can predict. Each class record includes a list of possible precision and coverage combinations to choose from. By default, solutions use the highest combination of precision and coverage available. You can select another combination to refine predictions based on acceptable precision and coverage values.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > Predictive Intelligence > Classification > Solutions. The system shows the list of available solutions.
2. Select the solution whose classes you want to configure. This solution must have a State of Solution Complete. The system shows the Solution record.
3. From the Class Confidence related list, select the class you want to configure. The solution only lists output field values for which it can make predictions. If the output field value is missing from this list, update the solution definition filter to provide more data for this output field value, and retrain the solution. The system shows the Class Confidence record.
4. Review the precision and coverage combinations available from the Precision Coverage Lookups embedded list.
5. Select the check box for the precision and coverage combination you want to use to make predictions for this class. You can only select one check box. Some combinations produce special prediction results.

# Special prediction combinations

# What to do next

Test predictions for this class to verify that the system produces acceptable results.

# Configuring target metrics for a trained classification solution

Set values for precision, coverage, and recall statistics for a trained machine learning solution.

# Setting classification metric values at the class or solution level

Predictive Intelligence provides three classification metric types: precision, coverage, and recall. You configure these metrics on the Solution Statistics tab of a trained classification solution form. While you can manually set values to these metrics at the class level, doing so can be challenging if you have a large number of classes to cover. In many cases, you may not know the best value to set until your solution is trained. This topic focuses on setting the metric values at just the solution level.

# Configuring solution metrics

When you apply a value to one metric, it changes the values of the other two. This behavior enables you to modify your metrics iteratively in real time to see which value combinations render particular results. When you apply a new value to a metric, the system recomputes it by considering its new targets.

Applying a value to a metric asks the system to train its predictions to favor the metric you set based on the highest percentage value, and at a cost to the other metrics. The system tries to meet these values but may not set them exactly as you request due to how the data you're training is distributed.

When you apply metric values at the solution level, the system automatically sets the appropriate values at the class level.

# Here are the basic steps for configuring a target metric for your solution.

1. Navigate to the Solution Statistics tab of a trained ML solution.
2. Review the messages on the green banners of the screen which define each of the metrics so you can better understand the values you want to assign to the solution. The first two message banners address estimated solution-level metrics. The third banner addresses class-level results based on the solution values you applied.
3. In the Target Metric choice list, select the metric you want to configure.
4. In the Target Metric Value field, enter a numeric percentile value between 0-100.
5. Click Apply Values.
6. Result: On the Solutions Statistics tab, you can review the change in values to the Estimated Solution Precision, Estimated Solution Recall, and Estimated Solution Coverage. The system calculates these values based on the Target Metric you select and the Target Metric Value you enter for the solution.

Here's a sample landing page for a recently trained classification solution. As you can see, the precision metric is 44.18, recall is 41.26, and coverage is 77.23.

If you need to adjust these default values for a use case, refer to the sample configurations below. For example, based on the classification solution you're implementing, you might want to change the target metric value for precision, recall, or coverage. Keep in mind that when you change the target metric value for one metric, such as precision, it impacts the values of the recall and coverage metrics as well.

# Precision configuration example

In this example scenario, you're replacing a manual triage process for routing incident records with an ML classification solution that automatically assigns the records to the correct assignment group. For this scenario, you have a target value in mind and the system must predict correctly at least 80% of the time. So you set the precision metric value to 80 and click Apply Values.

Here are the metric values the system applied to the solution. In this scenario, the precision value of 80.04 slightly exceeded your request for 80%, so you're likely satisfied with that value.

# Coverage configuration example

In another example scenario where you're replacing a manual triage process for routing incident records, your minimum goal is to predict at least 70% of incoming incidents in the first quarter of the year. So you set the coverage metric value to 70 and click Apply Values.

The metric values the system applied to the solution are shown in the following image. The coverage metric value increased from 35.99 to 55.98. However, the precision metric decreased from 80.18 to 64.97. This could be because you set the coverage metric to a relatively high value of 70, or perhaps because of how the data you're training is distributed.

# Recall configuration example

In another scenario, classifying if an incoming email is a Phish or not can be an important use case in a security-related machine learning solution. In this situation, it's very important to identify every Phish, and it may be okay to report a non-Phish as a Phish occasionally. However, no real Phish should be classified as a non-Phish. In such situations, the recall metric must have a high value, which might lead to lower percentages for precision and coverage. So here you can set the recall metric to 95 and click Apply Values.

Here are the metric values the system applied to the solution. The recall metric value increased from 54.87 to 61.03. However, the precision metric decreased from 60.1 to 55.44. This is likely because you set the recall metric to the high value of 95.

# Class-level results for the solution metric values you apply to your solution

The following image shows an example of the class-level results the system applied to a solution's precision, coverage, and recall statistics for 37 classes. You can keep modifying the metric values until you're fully satisfied with the results.

By Sorting (z to a) on the Estimated Precision column you can see which classes have the highest precision for the solution.

# Using Group By for classification

Use APIs to simultaneously submit multiple classification solutions for training based on the Group By field.

You can use the optional Group By capability to train and maintain one classification solution that covers more than one data area, such as geographical location or domain.

To train a solution using Group By, you must add the groupby parameter while creating a classification solution definition using APIs. The groupby parameter accepts only categorical columns as inputs, where individual models are created on the subset of data belonging to each of the groupby values. Only those child solutions that pass the minimum records criteria set for the capability are created. Here, the prediction calls are routed to the corresponding Group By model based on the Group By value present in the prediction input. Batch predictions are not supported.

# A Group By scenario for geographical locations

Let's say your global company uses classification routing for incoming records, with one support center in the US and one in Europe. Here, you want to create a single classification

# Solution for Incident Classification

In this scenario, you could use one of these two approaches:

- Create and train two separate ML classification solution definitions, where one is filtered by US incidents only, and one by European incidents only.
- Use the groupby parameter to create Groupby for the country location so that all US definitions create a US model and all European definitions create a European model. Then, based on the incident, the system identifies which model it uses to predict the correct classification category.

The second approach has benefits in that the models you use can even be in different domains, such as healthcare or finance. This approach is especially beneficial if you have several country locations or domains to maintain.

# Example usage for training and prediction using Group By via API

var myIncidentData = new sn_ml.DatasetDefinition({
'tableName' : 'incident',
'fieldNames' : ['category','short_description','assignment_group','description','priority'],
'encodedQuery' : 'activeANYTHING'
});

var mySolution = new sn_ml.ClassificationSolution({
'label': 'solution label',
'dataset' : myIncidentData,
'groupByFieldName' : 'assignment_group',
'predictedFieldName': 'category',
'inputFieldNames': ['short_description','description','priority']
});
//Add solution definition
var solution_gr = sn_ml.ClassificationSolutionStore.add(mySolution)
//Get existing solution
var my_unique_name = sn_ml.ClassificationSolutionStore.get('solution name');
// submit training job
var solutionVersion = my_unique_name.submitTrainingJob();

// Run prediction
var input = new GlideRecord("incident");
input.get("sys_id");
// configure optional parameters
var options = {};
options.apply_threshold = false;
var mlSolution = sn_ml.ClassificationSolutionStore.get('solution name');
//Prediction using glide record
var results = mlSolution.getActiveVersion().predict(input, options);
//Prediction using map
var results = mlSolution.getActiveVersion().predict([{ 'short_description': input.short_description, 'assignment_group': input.assignment_group }], options);

# Model Explainability

Analyze the importance of each input field to your model's predictions using model explainability. Create a Workflow Classification model that includes a graphical analysis of feature importance by executing the provided script.

# Before you begin

- This method uses the Workflow Classification Solution API, instead of the Solution Definition form, to create and train a model with explainability added. For information about the components of Workflow Classification models, see Create and train a classification solution.
- Role required: ml_admin or admin

# About this task

Model explainability helps identify the key features that influence the model's predictions during training.

Note: Explainability can't be added to an existing model. This method uses a script to create and train a new Workflow Classification model. For more information about scripting the creation of Classification solutions, see ClassificationSolution - Global.

The script provided in the procedure creates and trains a model with explainability set to true. On the new model's solution form, an additional tab labeled Feature Importance appears. This tab offers a graph of the relative contribution of each input to the prediction.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > System Definition > Scripts - Background.
2. Edit the query filter and table, field, and variable values in the following script according to your planned model, then execute the script.

// Define a dataset
var myIncidentData = new sn_ml.DatasetDefinition({
'tableName': 'incident',
});



---


# 3. Navigate to the ML Solutions [ml_solution] table and open your new solution by selecting the value of its Active field.

# 4. On the solution form, locate and open the Feature Importance tab.

Feature Importance displays a drop-down list.

- The label for this drop-down list is the name of your output (predicted) field, so the label is specific to each model.
- The values in the drop-down list are the possible output classes for your output field, plus the Global option.

Important: From the Washington DC release, models in the classification, clustering, and similarity frameworks use Workflow solutions. These are pre-trained, so a word corpus isn't needed for your new solutions. When your existing solutions with a word corpus are re-trained after upgrading, they become Workflow solutions, and the Word Corpus field is removed from the form.

About this task

After comparing your existing records based on similarity, the system recommends examples that you can review and reuse in your solution.

When applied in your forms and flows, similarity solutions are domain-aware, so records from other domains on the instance are not displayed to users. For more information, see KB article Similarity prediction behavior in domain separated environment on Now Support.

For information on using encrypted training data, see Data Encryption in Predictive Intelligence.

In this example procedure, you're working on Incident records and you want to locate relevant Knowledge Base articles that could provide resolutions to those incidents.

# Procedure

1. Ensure that you are in the application scope that you want for your solution definition, then navigate to All > Predictive Intelligence > Similarity > Solution Definitions.
2. In the Similarity Definitions list, select New.
3. On the Similarity Definition form, fill in the fields.

Name

As you enter a Label value, this field automatically populates with a system-assigned, read-only name based on your Label value.

Word Corpus

If you have a legacy similarity solution, you can select a relevant word corpus from the Word Corpus field in the definition form.

Note: Starting from the Washington DC release, a word corpus is not required because a pre-trained model is used instead. The Word Corpus field is not visible in the definition form for pre-trained models.

For more information, see Create a word corpus.

Table

In the Table field, select the table that contains records you want to use as an information source. In this use case you select the Knowledge [kb_knowledge] table, because its KB Article records might provide information relevant to the Incidents that you're trying to resolve.

After you assign a Table, the number of records matching your filter conditions is displayed as a link. Select this link to view the list of records.

Test Table

In the Test Table field, select the table containing the records that you want to target. In this use case, you select the Incident [incident] table, as it contains the Incident records that you're trying to resolve.

Note: You can select the same table for Table and Test Table. For example: using filter conditions, you could collect information from recent Incidents to help with target Incidents.

Fields

For the Table that you selected, enter fields that are likely to contain words and phrases relevant to the Incidents you're trying to resolve. In this example, you choose Short description and Article body. Including the article body increases your chances of capturing informative details regarding the subject.

Note: Journal Type is not a supported data type.

Test Fields

For the Test Table that you selected, enter fields that contain text that you want to compare to other similar records. In this example, you choose the Short description of the Incident records you're trying to resolve.

# 5. If you submitted the solution for training, select OK on the Training Activation window to confirm.

# Result

- The system schedules the solution definition for processing with the nearest training service and sends you a notification when the training completes. The notification includes any errors that may have occurred during the training. Other users can subscribe to the Predictive Intelligence Notifications category.
- The trained solution delivers paired example records ranked by their degree of similarity. The list of examples is available from Similarity Examples under Related Links on your solution's form.
- When training completes, the system uploads the solution as an Attachment record.

# What to do next

Review the similarity examples on the Related Links section of your Solution form. See Review solution similarity examples.

# Update your similarity score threshold

After you review the similarity examples provided by the system, update your solution similarity score threshold if you want the results returned by the solution to be more or less similar.

# Before you begin

- Review your similarity examples and their scores. For more information see Review solution similarity examples.
- Role required: ml_admin or admin

# About this task

A deployed solution returns records only when the similarity score is higher than the Similarity Score Threshold value:



---



• The higher the threshold value, the higher the precision and the lower the coverage.

• The lower the threshold value, the lower the precision and the higher the coverage.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > Predictive Intelligence > Similarity > Solutions.
2. In the ML Solutions list, locate your solution by filtering for the Solution Name, and open its active version.
3. On the solution form, locate and open the Solution Statistics tab.
4. In the Similarity Score Threshold field, enter a new numerical value that represents a percentage.
For example, imagine that the current threshold is 80. In your similarity example review you decided to increase the accuracy of your similarity recommendations at the cost of lowering the prediction coverage. So you update the field by entering the higher value of 90.
5. In the form's context menu (Additional actions), select Save.
Your solution uses the new threshold value that you assigned to it and returns similar results that have a score higher than 90. If you set the threshold to 90, the similarity score must be 91% or above to return records.

# Create and train a clustering solution

Group similar records into clusters so you can address them collectively or identify patterns.

# Before you begin

Role required: ml_admin or admin

Important: In the Zurich release, models in the classification, clustering, and similarity frameworks use Workflow solutions. These are pre-trained, so a word corpus isn't needed for your new solutions. When your existing solutions with a word corpus are re-trained after upgrading, they become Workflow solutions, and the Word Corpus field is removed from the form.

# About this task

In this example procedure, you're creating a solution to identify a major incident by grouping similar incidents that have occurred recently.

For information on using encrypted training data, see Data Encryption in Predictive Intelligence.

# Procedure

1. Ensure that you are in the application scope that you want for your solution definition, then navigate to All > Predictive Intelligence > Clustering > Solution Definitions.
2. On the Clustering Definitions list, select New.

# Field

# Value

Note: Script includes can't be referenced from the Filter. Use database views as an alternative.

# Processing Language

Select the dominant language of the dataset you're training on the solution definition. If the dataset language is Italian, choose Italian. Also, English processing is applied to all datasets by default. For example, if you select Italian, the system processes the data in both English and Italian.

Note: The term processing indicates some of the language-specific steps used as part of training a solution. For example, tokenizing words, removing stop words, and stemming.

# Stopwords

When you select your processing language, the system automatically adds a Stopwords list in that language. For example, if your processing language is Italian, the Default Italian Stopwords list appears. The Default English Stopwords list is also included. If you create a custom stopwords list, you can select it from the Stopwords field to add to your solution.

# Update Frequency

Select how often you want the system to update your clusters with new and updated records.

Note: The system pulls records based on the Group By filter conditions that you set on your clustering solution, if any.

For example, if you select Every 15 minutes, the system identifies which records have arrived within that time frame. The system tries to assign them to the existing clusters, or creates a new cluster if possible.

In this example, 20 new records arrive. If 16 of those records make it into an existing cluster and 4 don't, the system forms a new cluster for the four unassigned records.

You can also choose not to update your clusters at all.

# Training Frequency

Select how often you want the system to discard all previous cluster results and recreate clusters from the beginning. Your options range from daily, every third day, every seven days, or monthly. You can also choose to train your cluster once.

A treemap plot appears on the Cluster Visualization tab of your Clustering Solution Definition form. The plot shows the clusters the system formed for your solution in descending order from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. The treemap node labels are the Cluster Concept, which is created by the top words from the cluster, and helps you see the most prominent content found in each cluster.

Note: The Cluster Concept displays the top words from the processed input data, in the data's language. Depending on the language, the Cluster Concept may display words in their root form and so appear truncated.

Each node is colored from red to green depending on the cluster quality for that node. The Select Group filter appears only when you select the Use Group By and Group By fields on your Clustering Definition form. When you point to a cluster, you can see its Groupby value, Cluster Count, and Records in Groupby.

To make other dimensions from your source table available for filtering, add them as input fields on the solution definition form.

# Create and train a regression solution

Train your solution by using historical data to predict numeric outputs, such as a temperature or a stock price. For example, you can use regression to estimate the time it takes to resolve an incident or a case.

# Before you begin

- Important: Support for new regression solutions is deprecated in the Zurich release. You will still be able to edit and train any existing solutions, but you won't be able to create new ones.
- Role required: ml_admin or admin

# About this task

Regression solutions enable you to predict a point estimate and prediction interval. The resulting model delivers the following statistics:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which measures the mean deviation of a predicted value from the actual value. This metric is useful as it's easy to understand as its scale is the same as that of its target. However, MAE is unbounded, making it difficult to compare across models.
- Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) is a percentage value of the deviation from the predicted to the actual. SMAPE is a bounded version of MAE except that it has a value range between 0 and 100. The lower the SMAPE value, the better the model accuracy.
- Range Accuracy is the percentage of actual values between a predicted range. In other words, it's the range between the upper and lower bounds of the prediction. For example, if four out of five actuals lie within the predicted range, the range accuracy is 80%.
- Average Interval Width is the difference between the upper and lower bounds of the prediction. This metric explains how informative the interval is. The smaller the average width, the better the model.

When making predictions, regression also enables you to specify a confidence level for the prediction interval (range).

In this example procedure, you create and train a regression solution definition to predict the amount of time it takes to restore a cloud database.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > Predictive Intelligence > Regression > Solution Definitions.
2. On the Regression Definitions list, click New.
3. On the Regression Definition form, configure these fields per the following guidance.

# Field

# Value

Label Enter a unique name for your regression solution. For example, in this use case you could enter Regression Test for DB Restore.

Name As you enter your solution Label value, this field automatically populates with a system-assigned name that's similar to your label value.

Word Corpus Select an existing word corpus that's relevant to your solution. For example, in this use case you select a word corpus that has a title such as Incidents in the last 3 months.

If you don’t have a relevant word corpus, follow the steps to create a word corpus first. When the word corpus is complete, you can select it from the Word Corpus field in your Regression Definition form.

However, the word corpus selection is optional. If your input data has text columns and you don't choose a word corpus, your regression solution trains a new word corpus model by using the text columns in your input data. The resulting word corpus can be reused in any other regression solution or other ML solution type.

Note: A pre-trained model is used instead of the Word Corpus for users who activated Predictive Intelligence starting in Utah.

Table Select the database table on which you’re applying regression. The table should contain historical records the system can use to predict the length of time for its database restore.

Output Field Select the field whose value you want the predictive model to set.

In general, a good output field is a numeric, integer, or floating point field.

In this example scenario, you use the Duration field to measure a length of time. The output field should generate a numeric value.

Fields Select one or more field types that help the system identify the records you want to train using regression. In this example scenario, you use Short description, Source datacenter, Target datacenter, and Database size. (short_description, Sourcedc, Targetdc, and Dbsize.) Input field types can be string, nominal, or numeric.

Filter (Optional) Add filter conditions to the output field records that you want to train using regression.

# Value

Note:

- The minimum number of records for regression training is 10,000 records.
- The maximum number of records for regression training is limited to 300,000.

# Processing Language

Select the primary language of the dataset that you're training on the solution definition. If the dataset language is Italian, choose Italian. Also, English processing is applied to all datasets by default. For example, if you select Italian, the system processes the data in both English and Italian.

Note: The term processing indicates some of the language-specific steps used as part of training a solution. These steps include tokenizing words, removing stop words, and stemming.

# Stopwords

When you select your processing language, the system automatically adds a Stopwords list that uses the same language. For example, if your processing language is Italian, the Default Italian Stopwords list is displayed. The Default English Stopwords list also displays in your selection. If you create a custom stopwords list, you can select it from the Stopwords field to add it to your solution. In this scenario, you use the Default English Stopwords list.

# Training Frequency

Select how often the system regenerates the solution based on records matching the Filter. Your options include:

- Run Once
- Every 30 days
- Every 60 days
- Every 90 days
- Every 120 days
- Every 180 days

In this scenario, you select Every 30 days.

By default, the system runs training once. This practice provides you time to review and update the solution definition as needed until it provides acceptable coverage and precision values.

# Review classification solution statistics

The Solution Statistics dashboard in Predictive Intelligence has been deprecated in the Xanadu release. It provided precision and coverage statistics for each class in a classification solution.

# Before you begin

- Role required: admin, ml_admin, or ml_report_user

# About this task

Important: With the Zurich release, the Solution Statistics dashboard is deprecated. Upgrading customers can continue to use their existing Solutions Statistics dashboards from the application menu. For new customers onboarding with the Zurich release, the Solutions Statistics dashboard is not available. The following information is provided for legacy context.

The Solution Statistics dashboard lists the precision, coverage, and distribution for each class of active solutions. The system uses the classes with the highest number of records when it builds a solution. The number of classes predicted may be less than 50, and may skip a class if there is not enough historical data to build a solution that can predict the class confidently.

The Solution Statistics dashboard is different from the Solution Statistics tab in an ML Solution record. For more information, see Create and train a classification solution.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > Predictive Intelligence > Classification > Solution Statistics.
2. From Filter by solution, select the solution whose statistics you want to review.
3. From Filter by version, select the solution version whose statistics you want to review.
4. Click Apply. The system updates the dashboard based on the filters selected.
5. Identify classes with unwanted combinations of precision, coverage, and distribution values.

# Example

For example, identify classes that have low precision or coverage but a high distribution.

# 6. Identify any missing classes you want the model to include.

# Example

For example, identify any missing incident categories from the Incident classification solution.

# What to do next

If you're satisfied with the solution you've reviewed, the latest version is already active and ready to use. If you're not satisfied, you can choose a different version of the solution and make it active. You can also tune and retune the solution by configuring the class precision and coverage to use acceptable values.

# Review solution similarity examples

Review the similarity examples generated during solution training to determine whether the similarity score threshold meets your business requirements.

# Before you begin

- Train a similarity solution
- Role required: ml_admin or admin

# About this task

Solution training generates a set of paired record examples. Each pair includes a percentile score that estimates the degree of similarity between the two records. The higher the score, the higher the similarity, as follows:

- A score of 100 indicates identical records.
- A score of 0 indicates dissimilar records.

A deployed solution returns records only when the score is higher than the Similarity Score Threshold value:

- The higher the threshold value, the higher the precision and the lower the coverage.
- The lower the threshold value, the lower the precision and the higher the coverage.

On domain-separated instances, the following procedure displays records from all domains to ML admins. However, when solutions are applied in your forms and flows, similarity predictions are domain-aware. Examples from other domains on the instance are not displayed to users.

Note: The similarity filters specified in the solution definition aren't applied for similarity examples and are applied only during prediction.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > Predictive Intelligence > Similarity > Solutions.
2. In the ML Solutions list, locate your solution by filtering for the Solution Name, and open the active version.

# Using Predictive Intelligence

Train and use Predictive Intelligence solutions to accomplish various tasks and that integrate with other ServiceNow products, such as Document Intelligence and Task Intelligence.

# Overview of Predictive Intelligence

Predictive Intelligence is the interface by which you can train models on the ServiceNow AI Platform. These models enable you to predict, estimate, and identify patterns that can be used to route work, populate form fields, estimate wait times, and more.

- Show suggestions for relevant articles.
- Assign, categorize, and prioritize tasks.
- Detect major incidents.
- Recommend case resolutions.
- Prevent duplicate articles and ideas.
- Detect phishing attempts.

For more information about the different types of solutions available, see Explore Predictive Intelligence.

# Training your ML solutions

Predictive Intelligence enables you to train predictive models and machine-learning solutions that you can apply using data on your instances. The solutions you create use the frameworks to predict, recommend, and organize data. To get started, see Creating and training solutions.

You can also extend Predictive Intelligence to other processes and applications, such as:

- Incident categorization: Predicts the incident category based on the short description. See Predictive Intelligence for Incident Management.
- CSM case assignment: Predicts the case record assignment group based on the short description. See Predictive Intelligence for case management.

For more information, see ServiceNow apps and features that use Predictive Intelligence.

# Testing and monitoring predictions

After creating and training your solutions, call on the Predictive Intelligence API to make a solution prediction. Use the results to gauge the performance of the solution and make changes as needed.

You can track the coverage and precision of deployed predictive models using the Solution Statistics dashboard, which provides reporting on these prediction areas by default.

For more information, see Testing and monitoring predictions.

# Preparing your instance

For you to get the most out of Predictive Intelligence, you will want to prepare. You don't need to write code or do calculations, but deciding what you hope to do with the solution definitions will make implementation easier.

- Identify the problems that you want to solve with Predictive Intelligence.
- Have 30,000–300,000 high-quality records from which Predictive Intelligence can learn.
- Set your expectations.

Note: Inconsistencies or gaps in training data can cause incorrect or unreliable predictions.

# Implementation Process

Predictive Intelligence takes approximately 14 days to implement on a production instance.

- Day 1: Clone production instance over to a non-production instance.
- Days 2–10: Create a solution definition, train it on historical records, and validate that the solution works as desired on the non-production instance.
- Days 11–13: Create import and update sets to move the solution to production, train and validate on the new instance, and set the retraining frequency.
- Day 14 and on: Monitor the solution.

In general, non-production environments are where workflows can be tested and formatted before being moved over to the production instance to further train models and test predictions.

For more information about getting started with Predictive Intelligence, see our guide on how to get started with Predictive Intelligence.

# Using Machine Learning APIs

Use ServiceNow Machine Learning (ML) APIs to train Machine Learning models and run inferences.

ML APIs enable training solutions and managing solution versions. You can get and set active versions, monitor training status, and more. The ML API also provides encoders, which enable using term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) as a word corpus. Predictability estimates enable assessing the predictive value of table columns.

Note: Predictive Intelligence APIs run with full privileges before the Vancouver Patch 7 Hotfix 2b and Washington DC Patch 7 releases. With later releases, grant access using ACLs. For more information see Query ACLs.

# ML API class overview

This section briefly describes classes for training ML solutions and running inferences with trained solutions.

# Datasets

A dataset is a set of records including a table name, columns, and row selection criteria to use as input for ML training algorithms. Datasets don't contain the actual data.

For more information, see DatasetDefinition.

# ML objects – Solutions, Encoders, and Estimates

ML objects define a specific training configuration to apply on a dataset. Some operations are common across ML objects. Solution objects include classification, clustering, regression, and similarity.

Encoders are text processing objects that are either pre-trained or trained based on the language datasets you provide. You can train encoders that determine how the system interprets and processes text fields. For ML solutions that include text, you can train an encoder to specify how to process text and use the trained encoder in a solution.

PredictabilityEstimate objects estimate which fields in a dataset are predictable and the features on which this predictability is based.

For more information, see:

- ClassificationSolution
- ClusteringSolution
- Encoder
- PredictabilityEstimate
- RegressionSolution
- SimilaritySolution

# Stores

ML objects are maintained in a specific store for each object type. Each store class includes methods for add, get, update, and delete operations.

For more information, see:

---



# Versions

Each trained object results in a new version that you can run tasks on. Use the version API to get any solution version and run tasks on it.

For more information, see:

- ClassificationSolutionVersion
- ClusteringSolutionVersion
- EncoderVersion
- PredictabilityEstimateVersion
- RegressionSolutionVersion
- SimilaritySolutionVersion

# Putting it together: ML API flows

You can use the following flow to configure and train solutions, encoders, and predictability estimates:

# ML API flow – Solution, encoder, and estimate training

Note: The encoder definitions support multiple dataset definitions, but have the same training flow.

To train a solution with an encoder, create the encoder first, then include the encoder in the solution configuration.

# ML API flow – Solution API training with encoder

# ML object encoder requirements:

- Required in similarity API solutions.
- Required in clustering API solutions, unless using the Levenshtein distance algorithm, in which case encoders are optional.

# Getting started with ML API solution training

Follow this example breakdown to learn how to configure and train a solution.

# Configure and train a solution

1. Define a dataset using the DatasetDefinition API.

var myData = new sn_ml.DatasetDefinition({
'tableName' : 'incident',
'fieldNames' : ['assignment_group', 'short_description',
'description'],
'encodedQuery' : 'activeANYTHING'
});
2. Use the constructor to define the solution, including the dataset in the configuration.

var mySolution = new sn_ml.ClassificationSolution({
'label': "my solution definition",
'dataset' : myData,
'predictedFieldName' : 'assignment_group',
'inputFieldNames':['short_description']
});
- ClassificationSolution()
- ClusteringSolution()
- Encoder()
- PredictabilityEstimate()
- RegressionSolution()
- SimilaritySolution()
3. Add the solution definition to the store using the add() method.

var my_unique_name = sn_ml.ClassificationSolutionStore.add(mySolution);
- ClassificationSolutionStore - add()
- ClusteringSolutionStore – add()
- EncoderStore - add()
- PredictabilityEstimateStore - add()

# 4. Train the solution using the submitTrainingJob() method.

After training is complete, you can manage the trained solution using a solution version API. A solution can be retrained multiple times. Each training results in a new solution "version" on which you can run inferences.

var myClassifierVersion = mySolution.submitTrainingJob();
- ClassificationSolution - submitTrainingJob()
- ClusteringSolutionVersion – submitTrainingJob()
- Encoder - submitTrainingJob()
- PredictabilityEstimate - submitTrainingJob()
- RegressionSolution - submitTrainingJob()
- SimilaritySolution - submitTrainingJob()

# View all classification solutions in a store

You can use the store getAllNames() method to see a list of all solutions that have been added to the store.

gs.print(JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(sn_ml.ClassificationSolutionStore.getAllNames()), null, 2));
In the output, the system has named the solution ml_x_snc_global_global_my_solution_definition. Use this name in subsequent examples to get version information.

*** Script: [
"ml_incident_assignment",
"ml_x_snc_global_global_my_solution_definition",
"ml_incident_categorization"
]
- ClassificationSolutionStore - getAllNames()
- ClusteringSolutionStore – getAllNames()
- EncoderStore - getAllNames()
- PredictabilityEstimateStore - getAllNames()
- RegressionSolutionStore - getAllNames()
- SimilaritySolutionStore - getAllNames()

# Getting started with ML API solution versions

Follow these example breakdowns to learn how to manage trained solution versions.

# Check training status

Get the classification solution from the store, choose a version, and check its training status. The methods used for checking training status are applicable to all ML object types.

After the solution has been trained, get the trained version and run a prediction on it. Get the solution you created from the store. Next, choose the trained version and predict the trained version.

Note: Predictions cannot be made on encoders and predictability estimates.

1. Get the solution from the classification solution store using the get() method.

// Get the solution created in the first example from the
classification solution store
var mlSolution =
sn_ml.ClassificationSolutionStore.get('ml_x_snc_global_global_my_solution_definition');

Use the GlideRecord API get() method to provide a record from the Incident [incident] table.

// single GlideRecord input
var input = new GlideRecord("incident");
input.get("&#x3C;sys_id>");

Optional. Configure the ClassificationSolutionVersion – predict() method options parameter to return the top three results and return all results.

// configure optional parameters
var options = {};
options.top_n = 3;
options.apply_threshold = false;

Declare a variable called results and assign it to the prediction job. To run the prediction job, get the most recent solution version using the ClassificationSolution – getLatestVersion() method and call the ClassificationSolutionVersion – predict() method on it.

var results = mlSolution.getLatestVersion().predict(input,
options);

- ClassificationSolutionVersion - predict()
- ClusteringSolutionVersion – predict()
- RegressionSolutionVersion - predict()
- SimilaritySolutionVersion - predict()

Print the predicted results output.

gs.print(JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(results), null, 2));

# Background and usage

When you submit an ML solution or ML solution definition for training, it goes to a ServiceNow data center for processing to predict and deliver a data outcome. Depending on the solution size, the training can take hours or sometimes days to complete. The ML Training Jobs view helps you stay on top of all in-progress and completed ML solution training jobs in your instance.

To access this view, you use the admin or ml_admin role and the following navigation path:

Predictive Intelligence > Training Jobs.

Note: The ML scheduler limits the number of trainings an instance can commit to 50 new ML training requests per instance within a 24 hour window. This excludes scheduled re-training requests. In addition, clustering and similarity updates are also excluded from this limit, even if the new training requests exceed 50 within a 24 hour window.

# ML Training Jobs view summary

The view shows all ML training jobs grouped by the four Predictive Intelligence capability frameworks: classification, similarity, clustering, and regression.

Each record displays values such as solution name, version, training state, and training completion percentage.

If you don't have any training jobs for a particular capability, the list doesn't display a group for that capability. For example, in this scenario, there is no group for regression because you don't have any regression solutions that you've submitted for training yet.

Select the Solution Name to see the details of the ML solution, as demonstrated in the images below.

# Domain separation and Predictive Intelligence

Domain separation is supported in the Predictive Intelligence application. Domain separation enables you to separate data, processes, and administrative tasks into logical groupings called domains. You can control several aspects of this separation, including which users can see and access data.

Support level: Standard

- Includes all aspects of Basic level support.
- Application properties are domain-aware as needed.
- Business logic: The service provider (SP) creates or modifies processes per customer. The use cases reflect proper use of the application by multiple SP customers in a single instance.
- The instance owner must configure the minimum viable product (MVP) business logic and data parameters per tenant as expected for the specific application.

Sample use case: An admin must be able to make comments required when a record closes for one tenant, but not for another.

For more information on support levels, see Application support for domain separation.

# Overview of domain separation and Predictive Intelligence

With Predictive Intelligence, you can create machine learning solutions using historic datasets. A machine learning solution is created and trained in the global domain, and that solution's predictions can be applied in any domain on the instance.

Similarity solutions are domain-aware when applied in your forms and flows, so records from other domains on the instance are not displayed to users. For more information, see KB article Similarity prediction behavior in domain separated environment on Now Support.

# How domain separation works in Predictive Intelligence

An instance owner can train a machine learning (ML) solution for each domain by creating a solution definition for each domain and training those solutions. In this way each solution uses data specific to the corresponding domain.

- Data can be domain separated

# Database View support for Predictive Intelligence

Use database views to join two or more tables as input for your Machine Learning (ML) solution.

# Using database views in an ML solution

Database views help expand the amount of fields your solution can use for training. By using more than one table in your ML solution definition form, you can access more input data to help enrich the solution outcome.

Database views enable you to join two or more tables into one consolidated view. For this to work in an ML solution you must first create the database view. See Database views.

Database views are supported in all four of the Predictive Intelligence capability frameworks: classification, similarity, clustering, and regression.

# A database view example for Predictive Intelligence

In the following example scenario, you've created a database view for use in an ML similarity solution. The image below shows the database view record you've created, including its Name and Label.

When you click the record Name, its content appears, as shown in the image below. Within the database view content, the five Knowledge Base tables you've joined to the view are listed. Most of these tables contain different Knowledge article template types, such as an FAQ or a How To article.

When a database view is used as input to a similarity solution, each of the tables that constitute the view must have at least the required number of records set in the configuration of your ServiceNow instance. The default minimum number required is 10,000. For example,

The Knowledge View database view has five tables and each table must have 10,000 records. If a table doesn't have 10,000 records, you may not see the results from that table. If you must change that value, contact Customer Support.

In the image below you can see the similarity solution definition record you've already created, which you plan to associate to your database view. When you click the Label for your similarity record, its Similarity Definition form appears.

Similarity Definition forms compare your existing table records based on their similarity by using a table in the Table field and another table in the Test Table field.

To use a database view in your similarity solution, instead of selecting a table in the Table field, you select the database view you created, which in this example scenario is the Knowledge View database view. This configuration increases the number of records your

# Use Predictive Intelligence in Workflow Studio with ML actions

Use Predictive Intelligence actions in Workflow Studio to create flows that incorporate your model predictions.

# Before you begin

- Make sure the following plugins are activated in your instance: Predictive Intelligence (com.glide.platform_ml) and Predictive Intelligence for Workflow Studio (com.snc.ml_flowdesigner).
- Create or use an existing trained Predictive Intelligence solution.
- Roles required: ml_admin or admin, and flow_designer or delegated_developer.

# About this task

Workflow Studio enables you to automate complex processes. The first thing to identify is what process you want to automate. In this example scenario, you're automating the assignment of a Category to an incident record. When you complete the flow, the next incident record created in your instance updates the Category field in the record based on the text entered in the Short description field.

You can deploy any active and trained classification, similarity, or regression ML solution in your flow, as appropriate for your use case.

In this example procedure, you create a flow that implements the ml_incident_categorization solution in a Workflow Studio action. You can find this solution by searching on the ML Solutions [ml_solution] table, as shown in the image below. Confirm that the solution you use has been trained and its Active value is set to true.

For more information on how to use Flow Designer in Workflow Studio, see Exploring flows.

For information about the Actions included in Predictive Intelligence for Workflow Studio, see the Spoke actions table in Machine Learning solutions for Flow Designer.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > Process Automation > Workflow Studio.

# Machine Learning solutions for Flow Designer

Using MLSolutionFactory scriptable objects enable defining ML functionality. You can use the APIs to compose data-driven functionality, such as subclustering large clusters or clusters with multiple PRBs attached.

You can use scriptable objects in a scripted extension point to modify the Predictive Intelligence REST API method to address unique business use cases.

ServiceNow applications on the NOW platform can call scriptable objects and script includes. External applications can call scripted REST APIs. By default, the Predictive Intelligence REST API - Prediction for multiple solutions (GET) method uses the MLSolutionUtil scripted extension point to take a list of active solution names, run predictions on them given the input, and return results. The MLSolutionUtil extension point enables creating custom implementations for specific usage scenarios, for example, running a second solution prediction only after the condition of a first solution prediction is satisfied.

Here's the high-level process for creating a custom usage scenario.

# Developers customize a MLSolutionUtil scripted extension point implementation using the MLSolutionFactory scriptable object.

1. Listed as global.MLSolutionUtil in the Extension Point [sys_extension_point] table
2. See Register a custom script include

The MLSolutionUtil scripted extension point implementation uses MLSolutionFactory to get the scriptable object, and invokes prediction methods on that object.

The Predictive Intelligence REST API - Prediction for multiple solutions (GET) method invokes the MLSolutionUtil extension point implementation, depending on the scope of the request.

Applications call the Predictive Intelligence REST API - Prediction for multiple solutions (GET) end point from a script include form.

# Before the upgrade

# Document Intelligence 3.0 or later pre-upgrade checklist

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Pre-upgrade task</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Choose a time to schedule the upgrade</td>
<td>Avoid performing the upgrade during the run time of the nightly task definition (use case) upgrade job. Upgrading the application at that time would prevent use cases from upgrading until the run time of the next day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Update any custom code that points directly to DocIntel database tables</td>
<td>After upgrading to Document Intelligence 3.0 or later from version 2.4 or earlier, DocIntel will use new flow actions. DocIntel will also use ServiceNow AI Platform database tables (sys_di_) in place of the scoped application tables (di_). All DocIntel data will be migrated automatically to these platform tables. Note: Document extraction use cases may not be available for use until the migration is complete. If you have custom code in your instance that points directly to the scoped application tables (di_), it should be updated, preferably to the platform component using DocIntel APIs. If you have custom code using DocIntel 2.4 or earlier flow actions, it should be updated to use 3.0 or later flow actions. For the list of tables, see Components installed with Document Intelligence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Add cross-scope records for integrations</td>
<td>For any integrations with Document Intelligence, add cross-scope records for the new DocIntel database tables. Note: Ensure that the existing cross-scope records for the old tables are not removed. See the Cross-scope records section for the list of records to be added. For more detail on cross-scope records, see Cross-scope privilege record.</td>

# Set up document extraction use cases

In Document Intelligence, a use case is used to define the structure of a type of document you want to process. It's made up of the use case record and its related fields, field groups, integrations, flows, and all the related machine learning (ML) models.

# Overview of document extraction use cases

In a document extraction use case, you define the information that you want the AI to detect in a document. Do this by specifying the type of document to process, the fields to detect, and the location where document processing results are to be stored.

For example, if you want to process invoice documents, you may want an “Invoice” use case. This use case could have fields for date, invoice number, item, and so on, to define which information needs to be extracted from the document.

---


After you've defined a document extraction use case, agents can begin processing documents for it in document tasks.

Note: Use cases for Now Assist in Document Intelligence skills have a separate setup process. For more information, see Configuring Now Assist in Document Intelligence.

# Workflow

Set up a document extraction use case in the following steps.

1. Create a use case.
Define the name, target table, and language for the use case.
2. Create a field for data extraction.
Define the fields that the AI will learn to detect and extract values from.

Define any groupings of fields to help extract and organize data gathered from tables or information patterns, like check box lists.
3. Configure data extraction modes.
Define how fields should be extracted from documents in a document task.
4. Set up integrations.
Configure an integration to trigger document task processing or value extraction for workflows with other applications.

As agents work on document tasks to extract field values from individual documents, the AI will learn from the feedback and continue to improve.

# Create a document extraction use case

Create a use case record to define a document you want to process in Document Intelligence. For example, invoices or driving licenses.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > Document Intelligence > Document Data Extraction Administration > Use Cases.
2. Select New use case.
3. Enter a name for the use case.
4. Select a target table to store the document processing results for this use case.
5. Optional: Change the language model used to support document extraction. For more information, see Languages supported by Document Intelligence.
6. Select Save.

# What to do next

After creating a use case, finish setting it up by adding fields and configuring the data extraction modes.

# Create a field for data extraction

Set up fields as part of your use case. Document Intelligence uses fields to identify and extract data from documents. Fields can be grouped to help DocIntel extract data from documents with tables, check box lists, and other logical groupings of fields.

# Before you begin

Role required: sn_docintel.manager

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > Document Intelligence > Document Data Extraction Administration > Use Cases.
2. Select a use case in the list.
3. Go to the Fields tab and select Define your fields. If you have already defined one or more fields and you want to add another field, select New field.
4. Select the type of data that you want to extract from the document.

# You can choose one of the following types of data to extract:

- Single field - Single fields are used to extract a single piece of information in the document. For example, a document number or a customer name.
- Check box list - Check box lists are used to extract a check box or a group of check boxes. Each check box can be checked or cleared.
- Table - Tables are used to extract lists or tables of information. A table can have multiple columns. The number of list items or table rows doesn’t have to be known in advance.
- Single field group - Single field groups are used to extract values that are grouped in the document. For example, a location with an address, city, and country. Only one item can be extracted for a single field group, as opposed to the multiple rows extracted for a table.

A form displays based on the data type you selected.

# Extraction mode

Description manually enter the value. All fields must be reviewed.

Recommendations are ordered based on how confident the AI is in the prediction. As DocIntel continues processing your documents, recommendations improve over time.

# Auto-fill

DocIntel auto-fills the fields in the Document Intelligence workspace. All fields must be reviewed.

Auto-fill works only if the AI has enough confidence to make the prediction. You can change the confidence threshold by updating the Auto-fill threshold field in the use case.

# Fully automated

DocIntel automatically extracts the data for all fields and processes the document task if the confidence scores for all required fields are above the defined confidence threshold. Fields don’t need to be reviewed.

DocIntel becomes more confident over time, as it processes more and more documents. Choose Fully automated mode for frequently processed documents or if you’re confident in the system.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to All > Document Intelligence > Document Data Extraction Administration > Use Cases.
2. Select the use case that you would like to configure.
3. Select the settings icon ( ).
4. Select the extraction mode for the use case.
- If the DocIntel AI model needs further training to make recommendations with higher confidence scores, leave the default recommendation mode in place without selecting any other mode.
- If DocIntel provides recommendations with confidence scores above the specified threshold, select the Auto-fill mode option.
- If DocIntel auto-fills the required fields with very high confidence scores, select the Fully Automated mode option.
5. Optional: Adjust the auto-fill threshold and warning threshold for Auto-fill mode.

---


# Optional: Auto-fill threshold

DocIntel only auto-fills the fields if the confidence score of the top recommendation is at or above the percentage you define.

Fields with a confidence score lower than the threshold are left empty in the Document Intelligence workspace, and the recommendation mode is available to extract these fields.

# Optional: Warning threshold

DocIntel shows a warning for empty fields and auto-filled fields with a confidence score at or below the percentage that you define.

# 6. Optional: Adjust the confidence threshold for required fields in Fully automated mode.

DocIntel automatically completes and submits the document task if all required fields have a confidence score at or above the percentage you define in the Fully-automated threshold field.

If any required field is below the threshold, the document task isn’t submitted automatically and requires agent review. Fields that aren’t required may be left empty or unreviewed.

If there are no fields defined as required for the document task, then DocIntel automatically completes and submits the document task.

# 7. Select Save.

# Set up document classification use cases

A document classification use case is a set of categories used to classify your documents and their individual pages. It’s made up of the use case record and its related fields (classes), and all related machine learning (ML) models.

# Overview of document classification use cases

In a document classification use case, you define the classes or categories that you want the AI to detect and apply to a document. Do this by specifying the type of document to process, the classes to apply, and the location where document processing results are stored.

For example, if you want to process identification documents, you may want an “Identity Documents” use case. Then, add classes for passports, driver’s licenses, military IDs, and so on, to label which type of documents are being processed.

After you’ve defined a document classification use case, agents can begin processing documents for it in document tasks.

# Workflow

# Integrate with Customer Service Management

Document Intelligence provides document extraction capabilities to Customer Service Management (CSM). Extract relevant information from email and case attachments, such as credit card numbers or customer addresses, and add that information to cases.

Agents can review values for extracted fields and make corrections as needed by accessing the Document Intelligence interface directly from the case. From this interface, agents can confirm correct values, fix incorrect values, and continue to train the model. This Human In the Loop (HITL) interaction of verifying the recommended values enables agents to refine the model and continually improve performance.

Create use cases that identify the information to extract from attachments, such as invoices, and automatically add that information to case fields, depending on the configuration. Labels identify the extracted fields on the case form.

For more information, see Document Intelligence for CSM.

# How Document Intelligence works with CSM

When a case is created, the Document Intelligence for CSM feature checks to see:

- If the case has one or more attachments
- If the attachment types are specified in the sn_csm_ml_task.case.docintel.parsing_supported_types system property

If the case meets those requirements, the feature:

- Identifies the right use case to use based on the case or case type and the use case filters.
- Creates a task using the use case, the sys_id of each attachment, and the case reference.
- Sends the task, attachment sys_ids, and case reference as inputs to the prediction model.
- Uses optical character recognition (OCR) solutions to extract data from the documents.
- Sets the status of the task to Done after the solution has completed.
- If the extraction mode in the use case is set to Fully automated (straight through processing), the extracted field values are added to the case.
- If the extraction mode is set to Auto-fill or Recommendation, the agent can validate the field values in the Document Intelligence interface.

# Enable Document Intelligence for CSM

Set the system properties and activate the required flows to enable Document Intelligence for CSM.

See Document Intelligence for Customer Service.

# Integrate with Financial Services Operations

Document Intelligence provides document extraction capabilities to Financial Services Operations (FSO).

Document Intelligence integration with FSO enables machine learning (ML) to assist in quickly automating document processing and accurately extracting information from documents. Admins can further integrate Document Intelligence with the FSO Document Processor to enable users to extract and store fields from a document.



---


# How Document Intelligence works with FSO

Document Intelligence works within the Document Processor as follows:

- Creating a Document Type (sn_doc_processor_type) creates a record on DocIntel Use Case (sys_di_task_definition)
- Creating a Document Attribute (sn_doc_processor_attribute) creates a DocIntel field (sys_di_key) record
- Updating the Document Attribute record updates the field record

Creating a Document Verification Task (sn_doc_processor_verification_task) creates a DocIntel Document Task (sys_di_task) if it meets the following requirements:

- Document Verification task has "ocr_processing_needed" checked
- Document Verification task has a document attached
- Document Verification task is in state "Submitted"

After the DocIntel document task is complete, the values should be extracted to the Extracted Fields (sn_doc_processor_extracted_value) table.

# Enable Document Intelligence for FSO

Ensure all the necessary applications and plugins are installed and activated to enable Document Intelligence in the FSO Document Processor.

See Enable Document Intelligence for FSO.

# Integrate with Accounts Payable Operations

Document Intelligence provides document extraction capabilities to Accounts Payable Operations (com.sn_ap_ic).

Accounts Payable Operations uses the capabilities of Document Intelligence to extract information quickly and accurately from invoice documents that are received as email attachments and then create invoice records in the Accounts Payable Operations application.

For more information, see Accounts Payable Operations integration with Document Intelligence.

# How Document Intelligence works with Accounts Payable Operations

DocIntel for Accounts Payable Operations extracts the required information from invoices received as email attachments, creates invoice records in Accounts Payable Management, and adds the extracted information into the invoice records.

For more information, see How Accounts Payable Operations integration with Document Intelligence works.

# Enable Document Intelligence for Accounts Payable Operations

Ensure all the necessary applications and plugins are installed and activated to enable Document Intelligence in the Accounts Payable Operations application plugin.

# Confidence Scores

A confidence score is a measurement (percentage) of how reliable DocIntel is in providing a recommendation for a field. The higher the score, the more reliable the recommendation.

Confidence scores increase as the AI model is trained through user input when processing document tasks.

A score is displayed next to each recommendation.

---


# Confidence score

In some areas, the score is color-coded with a different color for each confidence score range.

- Green indicates high confidence (76%-100%)
- Yellow indicates medium confidence (50%-75%)
- Red indicates low confidence (0%-49%)

To configure confidence score thresholds, see Configure data extraction modes.

# Data extraction modes

Extraction modes determine how the data is extracted in the document task and how the task is processed. The mode changes the behavior of the fields in the Document Intelligence workspace.

DocIntel uses the following extraction modes.

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Extraction mode</td>
<td>Description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Recommendation</td>
<td>DocIntel provides recommendations for the fields in the Document Intelligence workspace. Choose the recommendation or manually enter the value. All fields must be reviewed. Recommendations are ordered based on how confident the AI is in the prediction. As DocIntel continues processing your documents, recommendations improve over time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Auto-fill</td>
<td>DocIntel auto-fills the fields in the Document Intelligence workspace. All fields must be reviewed. Auto-fill works only if the AI has enough confidence to make the prediction. You can change the confidence threshold by updating the Auto-fill threshold field in the use case.</td>
</tr>

# Extraction mode

# Description

Fully automated

DocIntel automatically extracts the data (Straight-through processing) for all fields and processes the document task if the confidence scores for all required fields are above the defined confidence threshold. Fields don’t need to be reviewed.

DocIntel becomes more confident over time, as it processes more and more documents. Choose Fully automated mode for frequently processed documents or if you’re confident in the system.

# Data normalization

Certain types of data extracted from documents are converted into a standard format so that they appear the same across all fields.

This process increases the usefulness of the data by enabling it to be grouped and analyzed more easily. It also supports integration with other applications on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

# Field types

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Field type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Date</td>
<td>Standard date format. For example, YYYY-MM-DD.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reference field</td>
<td>A field that uses a field in another table as a standard. DocIntel matches the extracted data to the standard.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

For example, a use case has a reference field called Vendor that points to the Name column in the Company table as the reference. When processing a document task, DocIntel extracts “Degas Dairy Products, Inc” from the document and fills the Vendor field with that value. DocIntel compares the value to the company names in the reference table and finds “Degas Dairy Products, Inc” as a match. In the document task, “Degas Dairy Products, Inc” is matched to “Degas Dairy Products, Inc” in the reference.

# Field type

# Description

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>Whole number. For example, 12.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Decimal</td>
<td>Number with up to two decimal places. For example, 12.5 or 12.55.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Floating point number</td>
<td>Number with up to seven decimal places. For example, 12.0 to 12.0000000.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

To set the field type, see Create a field for data extraction.

# Display

A completed data extraction field shows the converted value next to it.

You can adjust the converted date value by selecting Edit.

# Note:

In some cases, the data extracted from the document may not be in a valid format to be converted. For example, if DocIntel read the letter O instead of a number 0 in a date field (11.12.2o23), then it would not be converted. In this case, edit the field to the correct format.

# Ambiguous data

If there is data in a document that can be understood in more than one way, DocIntel interprets that value based on the default selected for it in the use case configuration. DocIntel must interpret an ambiguous value in order to accurately convert it to the normalized format.

For example, a use case has a Date field, and Month first is selected as the default order to interpret ambiguous dates. When a document containing the date 1/2/2024 is processed for the use case, DocIntel interprets that date as January 2, not February 1, when it extracts that value and converts it.

In such cases, the user completing a document task may need to confirm or correct the conversion of ambiguous values. Depending on the field’s configuration in the use case, automated document processing may be interrupted to ensure the conversion is accurate.

# Document field statuses

The following is a list of the statuses for fields in DocIntel document tasks. These statuses apply to fields for both document classification and data extraction.

# Document Task

A document processing activity in Document Intelligence. It includes the information that you want to extract from the document or documents.

# Extraction

In Document Intelligence, the process of identifying relevant information in a document and using it as a basis for the AI to recommend a field value.

# Field

A single piece of information to extract from a document in Document Intelligence. For example, the date on a document.

Fields are sometimes called keys or attributes.

# Field Group

A group of fields that belong together in Document Intelligence. Field groups are used to extract information from lists and tables.

For example, a group named "item" contains description, quantity, and unit price fields from a purchase order.

# Field Value

The final output of the Document Intelligence application. The output contains the values for the specified fields that were extracted for a given document task.

# Recommendation

A bit of text found on a document. The recommendation includes details about its location in the document, such as the page of a document and the specific location on that page.

The recommendations that the AI provides are sorted based on how likely the AI believes a given recommendation to be the correct value for the current field.

# Unstructured Document

A document that mainly contains free-form textual information and does not conform to a specific format or structure.

# Use Case

A use case is a set of configurations used to define the structure of a type of document that you want to process. It’s made up of the use case record and its related fields, field groups, integrations, flows, and all the related machine learning (ML) models. The use case also includes the mode for how the extraction should occur.

# Document Task Statuses

The following is a list of the statuses for DocIntel document tasks. These statuses apply to tasks for both document classification and data extraction.

# Task Intelligence workflow

The Task Intelligence Admin Console uses machine learning models. The models are statistical and can predict future data by training with your past data.

With the Admin Console, create, configure, train, test, and deploy predictive models used for automation in other ServiceNow features and applications, such as Customer Service Management (CSM).

Training a machine learning model is when the model learns patterns in past data to make predictions for new data. Models are trained using a lot of data so that they can learn patterns and the large data set makes the learned patterns statistically significant. By answering questions about your information systems, business process, and service operations, the system actively learns from your responses.

# Task Intelligence benefits

The Task Intelligence Admin Console provides admins with a no-code experience for deploying Task Intelligence solutions. The seamless experience helps you automate and optimize task creation, deflection, triaging, and resolution.

# Features are implemented by two applications:

- Task Intelligence for Customer Service
- Task Intelligence for ITSM

# Assess Your Model

The Assess Your Model screen also allows you to view example predictions on a sample of records. These examples demonstrate the predictions but do not necessarily reflect the quality or average performance of the model. The estimates provided on the Assess Your Model screen as well as the reports on the Monitoring page are calculated from a much larger number of cases.

You can also use the Assess Your Model screen to choose one of the following preferences for each field:

- Autofill the predicted value in the field.
- Recommendations are provided for the predicted value in the field.
- Monitor only and run the prediction model for the field only in the background.
- Turn off predictions for the field.

# Monitoring mode

Monitoring mode allows you to monitor the performance of a model at the field level without the predictions being applied to records. The model runs in the background only and can be trained and retrained until you are satisfied with its performance. You can set the model fields to Monitoring mode from the Assess Your Model screen when editing your model.

You can view and track model performance with the Task Intelligence Admin Console. See Task Intelligence Analytics and Monitoring.

# Assess field-level accuracy for multi-output models

# About this task

After you have created and tested your model, assess its performance to evaluate how well it's predicting what you want it to predict. For multi-output models that predict multiple fields, you may want to assess the performance of each field individually.

If you have not already created a model, see either Create a model to predict record fields or Create a model to predict incident fields to make one.

Your model must be in Monitoring mode. You can set Monitoring mode on the Assess Your Model screen. For more details, see the Set your preferences step in Create a case field prediction model or Create a model to predict incident fields.

# Procedure

1. Navigate to the Predictor Results (ml_predictor_results_task) by entering ml_predictor_results_task.list in the Application navigator.
2. Filter the Predicted Output Value Name for the name of the field you want to assess, such as "product" or "category."
3. Group the list by Predicted Correctly by selecting the list controls icon in the top left corner of the screen.
4. Divide the number of records where Predicted Correctly is true by the total number of records. This represents your accuracy for the specific field.
5. Follow steps 2-4 for each field in which you would like to calculate the accuracy.
6. Optional: View the performance of your model on the Monitoring screen.
1. Navigate to Task Intelligence for Customer Service > Monitoring in the Application navigator.
2. (Optional) The Monitoring screen allows you to select the model, field, and date range to display in the charts. Accuracy is measured based on whether the top autofilled value or the top 3 recommendations are correct.



---

# What to do next

If the accuracy of each field is acceptable, transition your model from monitoring mode to real-time predictions and deploy. If the accuracy of a specific field is not acceptable, you can remove that output field from your model, retrain, and deploy. See Edit a Task Intelligence model for more information on editing your model.

# Exploring Conversation Insights

Learn how Conversation Insights can help you to augment conversation insights with AI-based Inferred CSAT scores and factors.

# Conversation Insights overview

Conversation Insights is designed to deliver Inferred CSAT (customer satisfaction) scores and explanatory factors for conversations in Virtual Agent and agentic workflows. It leverages AI to analyze conversations in real time, and provide actionable insights that help improve Virtual Agent and live agent interactions, and agentic workflows.

Inferred CSAT is a numerical score from 1 (least satisfied) to 5 (most satisfied) predicted entirely from the conversation transcripts in real time without any input from the user. In addition to the CSAT score, the model also predicts CSAT factors that contributed to the CSAT score. The following CSAT factors are associated with the Inferred CSAT score.

- Resolution: Indicates whether the Virtual Agent or AI Agent successfully resolved user's issue without human intervention.
- Confusion: Indicates how often the Virtual Agent or AI Agent misunderstood or failed to interpret the user's intent.
- Effort: Indicates the number of user turns or interactions required to reach a resolution.
- Empathy: Indicates how well the Virtual Agent or AI Agent acknowledged and responded to the user's emotional tone.
- Next Steps: Captures whether the Virtual Agent or AI Agent clearly communicated what the user should do next.
- Frustration: Flags signs of user dissatisfaction or repeated failed attempts during the interaction.
- Transfers and Escalations: Tracks how often the Virtual Agent or AI Agent handed off the conversation to a human agent or another system.

Inferred CSAT scores and factors are calculated for each conversation. Conversational analytics applications can leverage the scores written to the Conversation Insights [sn_aci_insights] table to create custom dashboards and workflows. The data retention period for the Conversation Insights [sn_aci_insights] table is two years. For more information on creating custom dashboards, see Create a dashboard with the inline editor and Select a table data source for a data visualization.

# Conversation Insights workflow

The Conversation Insights workflow illustrates how each interaction, whether handled by Virtual Agent or an AI agent, is transformed into actionable insights that you can feed directly into the dashboards for analysis and decision making.

# Conversation Insights workflow

1. Conversation sources
- Agentic AI chats
- Virtual Agent chats
2. Data aggregation
- Agentic AI and Virtual Agent interactions are captured in the Conversation table [sys_cs_conversation].
- The conversation transcript, including user query, agent response, timestamps, and metadata such as session Id and channel type are also stored in the Conversation table for processing.
3. Insight generation
- The model analyzes the conversation transcript.
- Inferred CSAT scores are generated for CSAT factors such as Empathy, Resolution, Frustration, and so on.
4. Insights storage
- Inferred CSAT scores and factors are stored in the Conversation Insights table [sn_aci_insights].
- The Conversation Insights table acts as a structured repository for the extracted insights.
5. Dashboards
- The insights are made available to create adhoc dashboards and workflows.
- Users can explore trends, performance metrics, and target improvements based on the Inferred CSAT scores.
